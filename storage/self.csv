/r/self has been on Snoonet for a while, and its pretty empty in there.

#self is an IRC channel on Snoonet, reddits unofficial IRC network! For those that do not know, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an older but still really awesome live chatting protocol.

###How to connect: 

If you are new to IRC (Do not have a client): **http://webchat.snoonet.org/self** -- Nickname can be anything you want. Leave ""I have a password"" unchecked. Make sure #self is in the channel box

If you have an IRC client: irc.snoonet.org:6667 #self

----
###What to do:

#self, just like the subreddit, is very open. You are free to chat with people, or just idle.

Please note that as #self is new, not many people may be there/active. IRC can generally be quite slow, so feel free to hop on and 'idle'. If you really want to get in some more active channels, we would be happy to assist you. But feel free to say hi to us and others!

---
###Rules

While #self is a pretty open platform, there are some rules:

I (male, 24) was sexually abused when I was a kid. I don't remember exactly how old I was, definitely under 6, and I clearly remember my cousin (female, a few years older) doing sexual stuff to me. I'm not going to go into details, I'm just going to say that there was penetration (don't even know how that's possible at that age). Anyway, I feel like it hasn't affected me that much. I barely thought about it growing up, except a few times when it made me cringe a bit.

I feel like I'm a normal, functional person, with no major issues. No drug abuse, no troubles, just a regular dude. But then again, I'm 24, never had a ""real girlfriend"", never had sex, bla bla bla. I can tell girls find me attractive, and if I had to explain why I'm still a virgin, I'd say: bad luck, bad strategies, not going for it (especially this), and not caring.

But it hit me today that it might have affected me, but I'm just not aware of it. Has anyone been sexually abused and felt like it was no biggie?

TLDR: Sexually abused as a kid...meh

The apartment I'm in lacks a hood over the stove so when I cook (meat especially) I'm left with a light film of grease on most surfaces. When I turn the ceiling fan on it leaves a lovely Jackson Pollack artwork on my walls as the grease spin-arts around the room. I know the simply answer is to clean as often as possible but lets start with the fact that it's filthy now and I want to strip all the grease off as effortlessly as possible. What tips do you have to clean the following grimy surfaces?

(12'x10') Tan colored vinyl floor is filthy with dirt in high traffic areas.

White walls have splatter spots of grease from ceiling fan. Soft scrub didn't work on this.

Stove top can be cleaned well in most areas but the rings around the burners have black crud I'm unable to dissolve or scrub out.

Some cookware is simply layered with a greasy film that soap and water don't remove. My last test with Bar Keeper's Friend seemed promising.

My glassware is in a cabinet but because there's no ventilation there's actually a bit of a film on them as the grease creeps thought the gap in the doors. Any thoughts on sealing them? I've been thinking about foam window strips.

Luckily enough we spotted that the associate had also added extra data and messaging services totalling our first bill at $123 a month, despite us telling him that we didn't want any extras.

Naively, I thought that $80 meant $80, as I've come from the UK where you pay the price that you're quoted. Can anybody shed light on if this is a practice adopted by all cell phone coverage providers, and perhaps to what extent?

I love computers

I love gaming (don't need or want any games at the moment, though, and I gave him the $50 steam wallet card I got with my new mouse and we'll share that)

Wearing cheap (still sterling silver, cubic zirconia so they don't turn green and look expensove) jewelry, I don't care if I lose one. 
This might be one thing I could tell him, if I could find a cute pair of inexpensive earrings to add to the list.

I was pretty unsettled by it and felt inspired to write the following essay. I sent it to one local blog but they turned it down because it wasn't a local story, so I figured I'll just post it here. I'd love your feed back.

----


Many revelations in the Senate's torture report released earlier this week were abjectly horrific, but as a music fan and musician myself, the report of the CIA's ""weaponization of music"", [as Vox's Kelsey McKinney described it](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/11/7375961/cia-torture-music), was particularly unsettling to me. The CIA used music to ""break"" people by putting them in pitch black solitary confinement and blasting loud American music, most commonly metal and country, on repeat for days or weeks on end. Because music is an important way we are connected to our culture, and because the detainees from across the globe had no reference for western music, it drove them crazy and, according to the senate report, it was successfully used to ""break"" several detainees.

Maybe this is so unsettling to me because I put music on a pedestal. When I first fell in love with music, it was via the classic rock gods playing on 105.9 in my dad's truck. The hippy dream had a liberating appeal that my teenage self latched onto, and in some ways I never let go of. When [Jason Lee's character in Almost Famous said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buKbNGw7Ro4) ""One of these guys is going to save the world, and that mean's rock and roll can save the world"", I don't think this is quite what he had in mind. Nonetheless, while I spent my teenage years in the 2000s forming my own cultural connections by digging deeper into western music, the CIA forcefully tore down their captives' cultural connections with the same western music.

It seems a bit surreal - almost like a bad joke - to think that we used music to torture. While people all across the US jokingly referred to listening to Nickelback's music as torture, CIA interrogators may well have actually used it to torture their captives. While thousands of fans listened to Eminem on repeat in their room, trying to decipher and memorize the blistering lyrics coming out of Marshal Mathers' mouth, we forced our captives to listen to Slim Shady on repeat until they were completely detached from their culture, lost their sanity, and became willing to tell their interrogators anything they thought they wanted to hear to make it stop. 

Apple released the iPod about a month after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Three months later, the US Government founded the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center. Over the coming years the iPod swept the nation and rose to ubiquity. While the iPod appeared in [50 Cent's music video for ""P.I.M.P.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDApZhXTpH8), their silhouette [commercials with U2's ""Uno, dos, tres, catorce!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5vhgqmyVzw) were seared into our collective memory, and teens across the country put it at the top of their wish list to own a commodified piece of coolness or escape from their parents' world into their headphones.

Meanwhile, torture swept across the nation's most powerful and secretive governmental organizations, with the Justice Dept, the White House, the Senate, and the CIA all having a hand in justifying, approving, or carrying out the horrific acts we would first come to learn about through leaks, and now in more detail through this week's investigative report by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

These two stories, that in many ways define the lost decade of the 00s, probably crossed paths in US interrogation rooms in Cuba and across the globe. According to the Senate's report the torture techniques did not work at gaining accurate, actionable intelligence, so it seems that rock and roll did not save the world - not this time.

We sort of hit it off when we were talking and she seemed to be laughing a lot at my jokes.  I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and she said ya.  So I got her phone number and left the store.  

A few days later I try texting it and get nothing.  I brush it off.  I go there a few weeks later and talk to her again. I ask her about me texting her and she says she never got it.  I double check with her the phone number I have and she says that's accurate.  I figure okay.

A bit later I try calling her and she picks up.  We talk for a bit and she says she wants to hang out over the weekend.  Cue the weekend coming up and all I can get on her phone is a couple rings then the machine.  

Cue today: I go to the store again and she happens to be there.  We discuss me not being able to get a hold of her and she says she never got any other call from me. Phones must be fucking up again.  So I say let's fool proof this thing she's like ya. :) Like this whole flirty attitude is still on between us the whole time.  So she tells me her name on Facebook and I'm looking for it but I can't find it.  She takes off to go do something else and I wait for like ten minutes for her to come back and she never does.

Okay guys.  I know what you're thinking at this point and I get it.  I can't take a fucking hint.

Anyway when I get home from the store I realize I didn't get the $40 I asked for cash back.  I rush back to the store to talk talk to someone about it and when she sees me she books it to the back.  I tell the other cashier about the $40 and she says she cant do anything for me at the moment.  That's understandable, so I leave.

Moral of the story is, if you get a phone number and it doesn't work don't mention it to the girl again if you see her. She's not into you and you're going to realize you're being kind of creepy eventually.

Just to clarify though, from talking to her I never once got the vibe that she was uncomfortable.  Maybe some girls have a hard time showing they're not into you.

He helped me come up with a weight lose plan, and for the first month I followed it, but when it came to checking me weight again, I had only lost 2 pounds.
After this, I started looking into other methods to help me lose it quicker, but I never got anywhere. I started getting quite depressed over it and thought the best option would be to cut meals out, and ignore my cravings for food. This worked for a while but the weight was still taking ages to come off.
Not long after, I got this volunteer job in a local hall where I did the heavy lifting and running around as well as being part of the bar staff, and I started to notice how my weight was quickly dropping off, but I felt it still wasn't enough, so I stopped eating proper meals, but instead of eating sensible things, I relied on junk food, and of course the weight stopped dropping off and I was feeling really shitty.
I then just happened to come across this story on Tumblr about someone with anorexia, and how she had been through something similar, and the only way she stopped herself putting on weight was by eating and then throwing it up later. At first I thought no, but then I was pressured into eating a proper meal and I felt so bad for it that I went and threw it up straight after, and after I felt really good, I also thought at the time that I could stop when I was happy, so I kept eating my food and making people happy, and then throwing it up and making me happy, and with this, and my job, I got down to 11 Stone 9 and I reached a healthy weight.
But now, I'm having trouble stopping myself throwing up after meals, and I can't talk to anyone as I know they'll be disappointed, and I just don't know what to do and how to stop..

I grew up believing that people were essentially good. Just this shy of neutral, sure, but on the side of good. Then I revised it, people aren't good, good is defined by general altruism. So it didn't matter if they were good, what mattered to me is that I was good. I added to this a general sense of subjectivity: I couldn't objectively say what was good, just what was good in my perspective. 

I try not to bother people with my perspective, unless they are my friends and we have that relationship. 

But when I see some guy on Facebook, I don't even know how we are friends, defend torture by saying ""If we do it to ragheads, all the better. They're all scum."" Everything in me says ""wouldn't the most good be done by arguing here? At least let them and their sophomoric friends see what altruism looks like?""

But no, I don't know how to show altruism, by arguing with someone. I'm sure the skill exists, to present kindness to a person by refuting their statements, without them feeling attacked....but I do not hand that skill. 

So I say ""enough"" and walk away.

I get pushed around and intimidated by the woman I idolized, when I finally decide to step out of her life and cut her out of mine...she fights, not to keep me in her life, but to punish me for making that choice without her. Honestly, I'm afraid of her. I don't want to be around her. And when she realized that was the truth, and that others know that, she rages. She suffers. She tried to push me further. Her friends described this time as ""the most upset I've ever seen her.""

I want to help her, talk to her, tell we whatever she needs to know....because I never wanted anyone to be hurt. But I had said ""enough"". And I have to remember why I did that. I'm afraid of her for a reason. 

But I have the power to help her, at only my expense.

there is one other thing where you might disagree with me.  I don't think im a sociopath because i fell remorse but i might be a psychopath.

I think I have serious listening comprehension problems which destroys all chance of even developing a connection with someone. When I try to listen to what someone is saying, regardless if its a long sentence or short, what's said sometimes goes from one ear out to the other. I simply do not comprehend what is being said. I've even had friends point it out to me, and teachers from a very young age. ""Are you even listening?"" It's not that I don't want to listen, It's something else. I have been analysing my mind to investigate what exactly is going on when I don't comprehend something and I think I have figured it out. If someone says something to me...let's say they say ""hey I happened to find a stray dog"", the only thing that will synthesize is a fleeting mental image of the words in bold letters in my head ""Hey I happened to find a stray dog"". The problem is, I wont understand the freaking concept of what the person says.  All I will see is some movie caption of the words that have no meaning to them in real time conversation. It's as if I'm left with the shallowest form of language ever, just a bunch of words and letters.  I will have a blank stare and will HAVE NO IDEA what the person said.  
   If my mind was water, then the information people communicate to me would be oil. It simply does not ever mix efficiently; my brain does not seem to synthesize verbal language. It`s hard for me to understand concepts that aren`t Nouns especially. Does anyone else have this problem where speech just goes through one ear to the other? I am getting so fed up with myself because I know listening is pretty much the most important thing for communication. How the heck can I get better at listening? I've been experimenting with new methods of listening as well, such as imagining everything in mental imagery in my head while someone talks, which is kind of helping but It feels counter-intuitive and ineffecient. I feel like something is fundamentally wrong with me on a neurological level and I just cant figure it out. Let me know what your thoughts are!

I downloaded a program that would tell me which drivers were out of date, decided to update AMD Catalyst. Windows bluescreened and wouldn't start up again.

I managed to uninstall it using DDU and used System Restore. I downloaded a program to delete botched installations and did more damage. Now a ton of my programs wouldn't open due to errors, or closed when I opened them - most importantly my anti-virus.

I tried posting in /r/techsupport but it's always overloaded and no one responded. I tried to go to an earlier System Restore point but it was damaged.

So here's what I did:

* Bought key for Windows 8.1 Pro from Microsoft
* Moved all my files onto a separate hard drive
* Downloaded a .iso file of Windows 8.1 Pro from getintopc
* Put it on a flash drive using a Microsoft tool so it would perform like an installation DVD
* Got BIOS to boot from USB
* Formatted an existing partition
* Installed Windows on the previously formatted partition (it only took a few minutes!)
* Restarted the computer, put BIOS back to CD/DVD drive
* Restarted again, boom!

All my problems were solved now except the USB issue. Well I opened Device Manager and disabled USB ports until I found the finicky one.

Now everything is back to normal, and it only took me about 20 hours - but I'm super proud!

After transferring to a university in my hometown: Chicago, I thought it'd be just as easy to make friends and start new relationships as it was at my old university, but I found it's hard as a commuter, living with my parents until I graduate. Almost every day, I go to school, go to class, study, workout, and then go home, basically talking to no one for the past year. No one from my fraternity, or friends I made previously text or messaged me anymore, so when my cellphone reset and left me with only about 6 contacts, I was pretty damn happy I didn't need to look at that list anymore.

I made 2 friends, and we're pretty close, but it really lowers my self-esteem when I'm out with them at the bars. I thought I was pretty good looking, had girls at bars and friends that would comment on my looks and how big I am, but not in Chicago, unlike my friends. They're really good looking, one's getting hit on guys, the other's getting numbers from girls. Whenever I'm with my one guy friend at a club, if a group of girls approached us, they'd only want to dance with him, and I'd just tell him to go. 

Really just want to go out and fucking drink, but it's pathetic to drink at a bar alone just as much as it's pathetic to try and drink home at your parents. I'd try those dating apps and websites like Tinder, okcupid, or link, but I really hate my old university now, deleted all my old photos, and I basically only have 3 at most from the past year. Also I currently live with my parents which is a huge turnoff, and embarrassing. 

The only thing I can say is good is that my lifts have been going up, and that I don't even need to cut that much for get my 12% bf back. 

Birthday's next week and I'm probably either going to go out alone, because I don't want my friends to see how pathetic I am, or get an intense workout in.

I work full time at my internship which thankfully takes a majority of my time, and I have another really big one next month, so maybe I'll meet new people then.

I am a programmer and I often find myself doing repetitious blacklist/whitelist filtering when I perform searches for help on specific problems. Being somewhat obsessed with efficiency I made a Chrome Extension (Firefox in the works) that will save my filters and I can apply them from the url bar using Chrome's Omnibox.

The blacklisting ability also is wonderful for filtering out websites I know I don't want to see when I perform my search, and the example I use in the tutorial is if you are searching for 'apple' but you don't want any results from the domain 'apple.com' this will ensure that you never have to see them.

I intend to release this as a free item and take donations as I work on other extensions and applications.
