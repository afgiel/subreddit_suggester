I (male, 24) was sexually abused when I was a kid. I don't remember exactly how old I was, definitely under 6, and I clearly remember my cousin (female, a few years older) doing sexual stuff to me. I'm not going to go into details, I'm just going to say that there was penetration (don't even know how that's possible at that age). Anyway, I feel like it hasn't affected me that much. I barely thought about it growing up, except a few times when it made me cringe a bit.

I feel like I'm a normal, functional person, with no major issues. No drug abuse, no troubles, just a regular dude. But then again, I'm 24, never had a ""real girlfriend"", never had sex, bla bla bla. I can tell girls find me attractive, and if I had to explain why I'm still a virgin, I'd say: bad luck, bad strategies, not going for it (especially this), and not caring.

But it hit me today that it might have affected me, but I'm just not aware of it. Has anyone been sexually abused and felt like it was no biggie?
