Everyone was subject to spanking, belt/slipper/wooden spoon/coat hanger whippings. It often seemed like my parents were lashing their angers out on me, and my father would say things along the lines of ""this is what you get"", ""I dare you to try that again"" and just odd, demoralizing phrases during the whippings. And I distinctly remember them lasting a very long time, hovering around 25 minutes, followed by hours of being placed in isolation. My cousins had it even worse than my siblings and I, however, and their parents would punch and kick them as well.

But today, I'm a very level headed, compassionate person, and my siblings and I, alongside our cousins, have very close relationships with our parents. It's as though that part of my childhood did not happen. I love my parents more than anything, my mother is so generous and I find my father admirable hardworking. It hasn't caused any strain in our relationship now (though we did have a sticky past where social workers were involved). And the experience is pretty neutral to me. Maybe there's a cultural aspect to it, but I am Asian Canadian, and rather crude disciplinary action was the normative among other Asian peers of mine as well. We would share our similarity in beatings and find it quite laughable how close in nature they were. But we all still hold very deep, close and affectionate/loving/respectful relationships with our parents.

I don't want children, but if I hypothetically did, I would not use physical discipline, or ""corporal punishment"" as the legal Canadian terms define it.

Is not just the views themselves, is how FREQUENTLY this sexist shit is always on my front page,  on askmen, and getting upvoted every DAY. I haven't been able to browse anywhere without coming upon some sort of 'women suck' sentiment of some description every few hours that's heavily agreed with. 

This is seriously getting me down. I didn't even believe in any kind of gender war,  but apparently there's one happening all the time orchestrated by these evil spermjackjng rape accusing female overlords? Wtf.

I used to view men as people.  Reddit is starting to make me view them as something dangerous that doesn't view me as a human being.

It's mine and my partner's anniversary. We both are very, very busy so we don't get days off together very often. We actually have 24 hours off together today to celebrate our special day. We're going to the spa, getting a hotel room, etc.

The only issue is I'm PMSing REALLY bad. I get super hormonal and emotional. I cramp really hard and I'm generally really on edge and snappy.

I need some advice here: what are your tips and tricks to deal with this time of the month so you're not such a pain in the ass to deal with? ",,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,,True,t3_2p3jo9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2p3jo9/serious_how_do_you_deal_with_pmsing/,
