I was an idiot. I knew what I was doing when I entertained your flirtations. Full well. I was still licking my wounds over A, and in my mind.. I needed a distraction to get back on the horse, so to speak.  I figured if I hung out with you long enough, I would finally start to get my head straight about A.  Besides, you had just gotten out of a long term relationship, so cool.. mutual situation. 

Every day for over 2 months, you would message me. Send me random messages.  We played the game, both knowing full well what was up. You pursued. 

We finally even went out, and dinner was awesome. It was nice. And then eventually.... 

Well, I suppose this is where I post here and be honest, because I'm not mean enough to be straight up to your face (and trust me, you're not nearly as attractive as you think).

The sex? What little there was? BORING. And yes, I totally faked.  Christ. You think way too highly of yourself, considering there is NO substance. You want your women to lie there, be submissive, and not make noise? If you can't handle a passionate woman who is secure in herself? The problem lies with YOU, not me. You want to dish out pain but can't take it? Yeah. Okay.

See, that I could handle. Because I knew what I was doing with you. You were a temporary replacement. You were an impulse, a comfort item. One I ... yeah, I regretted. 

 You're pathetic. PATHETIC. Why?  Because you chase these insecure women much younger than you just to placate your ego. Because in you ""re-imagining"" of yourself as ""testosterone man"", you need weak woman in order to make yourself feel better as this ridiculous idea of a ""man"".  You obviously cannot handle someone your own age that is a challenge.

And the worst part is?  I know you know it. You're a fucking coward.  And a loser. And you're smart enough to know it.  I don't have to tell you these things, because I know you know them. 

Maybe THAT is why you don't message me anymore. I left it alone, because frankly, I don't care enough to chase, but the fact was, I enjoyed talking to you. Your excuse for not talking to me? Because I didn't want to hear about your other conquests. I said I don't care about your dating habits, but even as such, that doesn't mean I want to hear about them. And suddenly, you stop talking to me. Because I A. tell you the truth (which you don't want to hear), and B. I don't justify or validate the bullshit you're pulling in that very transparent and lame attempt to make yourself look better and more like this imaginary ""man"" image you speak of.

Posting all those photos? Is only proving your ex right, you know. Middle-aged men who post photos of mostly naked chicks half their age? It's not ""art""..  it's lame. So you can nail chicks your daughter's age with daddy issues. That makes you.. not a man... just a coward with a dick.

The worst part? I may not be over A, but instead, you made him look like the shining example of a man by comparison. 

I feel sorry for you, honestly. And watching your behavior now? I'm kind of embarrassed that I went there. But I was still mature enough to be okay with being friends after the fact, but you're acting like a high school moron, and I really don't want any part of someone who is gonna act the way you do. 

But I sure will sit by and watch while you crash and burn. Get a fucking grip, dude.

these words won't be easy to type down. And I really don't need to name all the beautiful times we shared together. Known each other since we've been 11, didn't really care much about one another, when at the age of 16 a new friendship blossomed. Now, 13 years later we have been drifting apart ... drifting away, ... and I haven't felt so good in a long time. 


All we had to talk about anymore was ""good ol' times"", your ex-boyfriend who cheated on you for 4 years, my ex-boyfriend who has treated me miserabley, our mutual friends and their fucked up relationships, about people who shouldn't concern us whatsoever. 


Throughout the 4 years I moved to another city here in Europe to go to University I met one of my closest friends - someone who has not spoken one bad word about another individual - in 5 years friendship. Never have I appreciated a quality in a friend as much as this one .... and you on the other hand, this is all you do pretty much - talk about others. Me - I am not better, I have done it with you, and it made me feel like **shit**.


I had to let go finally, I had to move on, away from it ... I had to move on from the person who said ""Ruben? Really, you want to date him? Don't you think he's a little too smart for you, would you even know what you could talk about with him?!"" - bitch, really? Looking back, this makes me furious ... and I considered you a friend. And I really don't want to feel grief; not being one of your friends makes me a more pleasant person to myself! And all that because you actually couldn't stand the thought of this great guy being interested in me. 
PFUI! at you.

I also had to let go of the person who texted a guy on MySpace who has been a mutual friend of a friend when she heard that he is interested in me. She couldn't take it, maybe .. maybe she desperadtley wanted a boyfriend after she has been single for 5 months after 4.5 years relationship. I don't know what it was. Texting me, asking in behalf of him if I wanted to meet up with him and pretty much put a ""no!"" in my mouth. 
I remember I didn't care enough, but I wasn't 100 % certain of what I wanted at that time.
A few weeks later you and him got together ... a few years later you're telling me that he only *wanted to fuck me anyways*, and after he got to know me better he couldn't imagine anything else with me anyways.
God, if I had been you, I'd be disgusted with myself for saying such nasty things to a close friend.


You, who cheated on the guy who wanted to date me, the one who has been with you for 6 years ... cheated on him with the ex-boyfriend who cheated on you for 5 years without you knowing. Yet, you don't have the courage to tell him about it, and live this lie ... but that's none of my business. I won't tell him.


Especially YOU - who ruined one of my friendships when I trusted you with how I saw her making out with another guy and not knowing how to handle it (I was young and dumb) and hearing your words ""Sorry, I can't keep this to myself, I have to tell my boyfriend so he can tell the girls boyfriend."" .... and yes, she hated me for 4 years after it came out, after everyone blamed me for snitching ... for calling her out... I didn't want to make it MY business, all I wanted was to talk to a friend about it. So THANKYOU FOR THAT! And I never got a sorry for that ......


The best part of this ... she (the girl I just mentioned) forgave me, and we are building up a wonderful friendships years later. 



I think I am hurt, I am upset, I am sad. I am all these things, but the most intense feel I am getting is happiness for realizing that this was rather toxic. 

I forgive you, and I am grateful for the good times we shared.

Hell, considering how good you are at reading me, I imagine it's plain as day to you, but you know me- I like dramatic confessions like this.
When we first started what eventually turned into a relationship I was kind of hesitant- I didn't know you very well, and I was kind of scared that I was going to end up just being...well, disposable, which is why I tried to find someone else- I was falling for you, and figured there was no way in hell you'd ever feel that way about me.

When you told me you wanted to be with me, I'd like to say I was overjoyed, but I was more confused than anything. I didn't understand why you'd waited so long to say something, why you just sat back and watched as I pursued another guy. I guess a part of me still doesn't understand how or why you didn't have issue with be being with someone else, and every time you bring it up I'm worried that it hurt you. Honestly, I would have pursued you, but like I said, I couldn't even imagine you having feelings for me. 

But I am so, so happy you do. At first I wasn't sure if a relationship would work between the two of us- we're very, very different people, and you're not exactly the kind of guy I normally date. We took things slow at first, and I think that was the right move, because I was kind of scared you might change your mind and leave, as silly as that sounds, and easing into being together like we did kind of helped reassure me you weren't going anywhere. And now, over half a year later, you're still here. You managed to charm my family (something I once thought virtually impossible, but they LOVE you) and your family has been kindness itself to me, you understand that I have limits and respect my boundaries, and I genuinely believe you make me a better person. Being around you makes me feel not only happy, but like I can actually change the things in my life that need changing and improve myself. You make me feel like I have a future, not just with you but in general.

And, well, I want that future to be with you. I know your feelings about marriage and stuff, and that's not really what I had in mind, I just want to be with you. I want to be able to go to sleep beside you every night, and wake up next to you every morning. I want to share my life with you, and I know that's a lot to ask so soon, so I won't. Not yet, at least.

All I want right now is for you to say how you feel about me. I know you don't like articulating that kind of thing, and that's fine, I'm not going to force the issue, but it would mean the world to me if you would just look me in the eye and tell me how you feel. And hey, if you love me too, it would make me the happiest person in the world to hear you say it.

So, thank you for an amazing six months, I really hope you never find this post, and I love you.

And I really don't want to feel grief; not being one of your friends makes me a more pleasant person to myself! And all that because you actually couldn't stand the thought of this great guy being interested in me. 
PFUI! at you.

I also had to let go of the person who texted a guy on MySpace who has been a mutual friend of a friend when she heard that he is interested in me. She couldn't take it, maybe .. maybe she desperadtley wanted a boyfriend after she has been single for 5 months after 4.5 years relationship. I don't know what it was. Texting me, asking in behalf of him if I wanted to meet up with him and pretty much put a ""no!"" in my mouth. 
I remember I didn't care enough, but I wasn't 100 % certain of what I wanted at that time.
A few weeks later you and him got together ... a few years later you're telling me that he only *wanted to fuck me anyways*, and after he got to know me better he couldn't imagine anything else with me anyways.
God, if I had been you, I'd be disgusted with myself for saying such nasty things to a close friend.


You, who cheated on the guy who wanted to date me, the one who has been with you for 6 years ... cheated on him with the ex-boyfriend who cheated on you for 5 years without you knowing. Yet, you don't have the courage to tell him about it, and live this lie ... but that's none of my business. I won't tell him.


Especially YOU - who ruined one of my friendships when I trusted you with how I saw her making out with another guy and not knowing how to handle it (I was young and dumb) and hearing your words ""Sorry, I can't keep this to myself, I have to tell my boyfriend so he can tell the girls boyfriend."" .... and yes, she hated me for 4 years after it came out, after everyone blamed me for snitching ... for calling her out... I didn't want to make it MY business, all I wanted was to talk to a friend about it. So THANKYOU FOR THAT! And I never got a sorry for that ......


The best part of this ... she (the girl I just mentioned) forgave me, and we are building up a wonderful friendships years later. 



I think I am hurt, I am upset, I am sad. I am all these things, but the most intense feel I am getting is happiness for realizing that this was rather toxic. 

I forgive you, and I am grateful for the good times we shared.

Go fuck yourself. I despise two-faced people like you. There's a special place in hell for ones like you. No wonder you're so full of anxiety, that's what happens to two-faced fucks. Keep bragging yourself up, but know that no one cares. No one.

1418364942.0,4,self.UnsentLetters,2p20wg,I love you,Connect_the_squares,4,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2p20wg/i_love_you/,"I know you know I do, it's not like I make a secret of it. Hell, considering how good you are at reading me, I imagine it's plain as day to you, but you know me- I like dramatic confessions like this.
When we first started what eventually turned into a relationship I was kind of hesitant- I didn't know you very well, and I was kind of scared that I was going to end up just being...well, disposable, which is why I tried to find someone else- I was falling for you, and figured there was no way in hell you'd ever feel that way about me.

When you told me you wanted to be with me, I'd like to say I was overjoyed, but I was more confused than anything. I didn't understand why you'd waited so long to say something, why you just sat back and watched as I pursued another guy. I guess a part of me still doesn't understand how or why you didn't have issue with be being with someone else, and every time you bring it up I'm worried that it hurt you. Honestly, I would have pursued you, but like I said, I couldn't even imagine you having feelings for me. 

But I am so, so happy you do. At first I wasn't sure if a relationship would work between the two of us- we're very, very different people, and you're not exactly the kind of guy I normally date. We took things slow at first, and I think that was the right move, because I was kind of scared you might change your mind and leave, as silly as that sounds, and easing into being together like we did kind of helped reassure me you weren't going anywhere. And now, over half a year later, you're still here. You managed to charm my family (something I once thought virtually impossible, but they LOVE you) and your family has been kindness itself to me, you understand that I have limits and respect my boundaries, and I genuinely believe you make me a better person. Being around you makes me feel not only happy, but like I can actually change the things in my life that need changing and improve myself. You make me feel like I have a future, not just with you but in general.

And, well, I want that future to be with you. I know your feelings about marriage and stuff, and that's not really what I had in mind, I just want to be with you. I want to be able to go to sleep beside you every night, and wake up next to you every morning. I want to share my life with you, and I know that's a lot to ask so soon, so I won't. Not yet, at least.

All I want right now is for you to say how you feel about me. I know you don't like articulating that kind of thing, and that's fine, I'm not going to force the issue, but it would mean the world to me if you would just look me in the eye and tell me how you feel. And hey, if you love me too, it would make me the happiest person in the world to hear you say it.

So, thank you for an amazing six months, I really hope you never find this post, and I love you.
