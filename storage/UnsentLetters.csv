I was an idiot. I knew what I was doing when I entertained your flirtations. Full well. I was still licking my wounds over A, and in my mind.. I needed a distraction to get back on the horse, so to speak.  I figured if I hung out with you long enough, I would finally start to get my head straight about A.  Besides, you had just gotten out of a long term relationship, so cool.. mutual situation. 

Every day for over 2 months, you would message me. Send me random messages.  We played the game, both knowing full well what was up. You pursued. 

We finally even went out, and dinner was awesome. It was nice. And then eventually.... 

Well, I suppose this is where I post here and be honest, because I'm not mean enough to be straight up to your face (and trust me, you're not nearly as attractive as you think).

The sex? What little there was? BORING. And yes, I totally faked.  Christ. You think way too highly of yourself, considering there is NO substance. You want your women to lie there, be submissive, and not make noise? If you can't handle a passionate woman who is secure in herself? The problem lies with YOU, not me. You want to dish out pain but can't take it? Yeah. Okay.

See, that I could handle. Because I knew what I was doing with you. You were a temporary replacement. You were an impulse, a comfort item. One I ... yeah, I regretted. 

 You're pathetic. PATHETIC. Why?  Because you chase these insecure women much younger than you just to placate your ego. Because in you ""re-imagining"" of yourself as ""testosterone man"", you need weak woman in order to make yourself feel better as this ridiculous idea of a ""man"".  You obviously cannot handle someone your own age that is a challenge.

And the worst part is?  I know you know it. You're a fucking coward.  And a loser. And you're smart enough to know it.  I don't have to tell you these things, because I know you know them. 

Maybe THAT is why you don't message me anymore. I left it alone, because frankly, I don't care enough to chase, but the fact was, I enjoyed talking to you. Your excuse for not talking to me? Because I didn't want to hear about your other conquests. I said I don't care about your dating habits, but even as such, that doesn't mean I want to hear about them. And suddenly, you stop talking to me. Because I A. tell you the truth (which you don't want to hear), and B. I don't justify or validate the bullshit you're pulling in that very transparent and lame attempt to make yourself look better and more like this imaginary ""man"" image you speak of.

Posting all those photos? Is only proving your ex right, you know. Middle-aged men who post photos of mostly naked chicks half their age? It's not ""art""..  it's lame. So you can nail chicks your daughter's age with daddy issues. That makes you.. not a man... just a coward with a dick.

The worst part? I may not be over A, but instead, you made him look like the shining example of a man by comparison. 

I feel sorry for you, honestly. And watching your behavior now? I'm kind of embarrassed that I went there. But I was still mature enough to be okay with being friends after the fact, but you're acting like a high school moron, and I really don't want any part of someone who is gonna act the way you do. 

But I sure will sit by and watch while you crash and burn. Get a fucking grip, dude.

these words won't be easy to type down. And I really don't need to name all the beautiful times we shared together. Known each other since we've been 11, didn't really care much about one another, when at the age of 16 a new friendship blossomed. Now, 13 years later we have been drifting apart ... drifting away, ... and I haven't felt so good in a long time. 


All we had to talk about anymore was ""good ol' times"", your ex-boyfriend who cheated on you for 4 years, my ex-boyfriend who has treated me miserabley, our mutual friends and their fucked up relationships, about people who shouldn't concern us whatsoever. 


Throughout the 4 years I moved to another city here in Europe to go to University I met one of my closest friends - someone who has not spoken one bad word about another individual - in 5 years friendship. Never have I appreciated a quality in a friend as much as this one .... and you on the other hand, this is all you do pretty much - talk about others. Me - I am not better, I have done it with you, and it made me feel like **shit**.


I had to let go finally, I had to move on, away from it ... I had to move on from the person who said ""Ruben? Really, you want to date him? Don't you think he's a little too smart for you, would you even know what you could talk about with him?!"" - bitch, really? Looking back, this makes me furious ... and I considered you a friend. And I really don't want to feel grief; not being one of your friends makes me a more pleasant person to myself! And all that because you actually couldn't stand the thought of this great guy being interested in me. 
PFUI! at you.

I also had to let go of the person who texted a guy on MySpace who has been a mutual friend of a friend when she heard that he is interested in me. She couldn't take it, maybe .. maybe she desperadtley wanted a boyfriend after she has been single for 5 months after 4.5 years relationship. I don't know what it was. Texting me, asking in behalf of him if I wanted to meet up with him and pretty much put a ""no!"" in my mouth. 
I remember I didn't care enough, but I wasn't 100 % certain of what I wanted at that time.
A few weeks later you and him got together ... a few years later you're telling me that he only *wanted to fuck me anyways*, and after he got to know me better he couldn't imagine anything else with me anyways.
God, if I had been you, I'd be disgusted with myself for saying such nasty things to a close friend.


You, who cheated on the guy who wanted to date me, the one who has been with you for 6 years ... cheated on him with the ex-boyfriend who cheated on you for 5 years without you knowing. Yet, you don't have the courage to tell him about it, and live this lie ... but that's none of my business. I won't tell him.


Especially YOU - who ruined one of my friendships when I trusted you with how I saw her making out with another guy and not knowing how to handle it (I was young and dumb) and hearing your words ""Sorry, I can't keep this to myself, I have to tell my boyfriend so he can tell the girls boyfriend."" .... and yes, she hated me for 4 years after it came out, after everyone blamed me for snitching ... for calling her out... I didn't want to make it MY business, all I wanted was to talk to a friend about it. So THANKYOU FOR THAT! And I never got a sorry for that ......


The best part of this ... she (the girl I just mentioned) forgave me, and we are building up a wonderful friendships years later. 



I think I am hurt, I am upset, I am sad. I am all these things, but the most intense feel I am getting is happiness for realizing that this was rather toxic. 

I forgive you, and I am grateful for the good times we shared.

Hell, considering how good you are at reading me, I imagine it's plain as day to you, but you know me- I like dramatic confessions like this.
When we first started what eventually turned into a relationship I was kind of hesitant- I didn't know you very well, and I was kind of scared that I was going to end up just being...well, disposable, which is why I tried to find someone else- I was falling for you, and figured there was no way in hell you'd ever feel that way about me.

When you told me you wanted to be with me, I'd like to say I was overjoyed, but I was more confused than anything. I didn't understand why you'd waited so long to say something, why you just sat back and watched as I pursued another guy. I guess a part of me still doesn't understand how or why you didn't have issue with be being with someone else, and every time you bring it up I'm worried that it hurt you. Honestly, I would have pursued you, but like I said, I couldn't even imagine you having feelings for me. 

But I am so, so happy you do. At first I wasn't sure if a relationship would work between the two of us- we're very, very different people, and you're not exactly the kind of guy I normally date. We took things slow at first, and I think that was the right move, because I was kind of scared you might change your mind and leave, as silly as that sounds, and easing into being together like we did kind of helped reassure me you weren't going anywhere. And now, over half a year later, you're still here. You managed to charm my family (something I once thought virtually impossible, but they LOVE you) and your family has been kindness itself to me, you understand that I have limits and respect my boundaries, and I genuinely believe you make me a better person. Being around you makes me feel not only happy, but like I can actually change the things in my life that need changing and improve myself. You make me feel like I have a future, not just with you but in general.

And, well, I want that future to be with you. I know your feelings about marriage and stuff, and that's not really what I had in mind, I just want to be with you. I want to be able to go to sleep beside you every night, and wake up next to you every morning. I want to share my life with you, and I know that's a lot to ask so soon, so I won't. Not yet, at least.

All I want right now is for you to say how you feel about me. I know you don't like articulating that kind of thing, and that's fine, I'm not going to force the issue, but it would mean the world to me if you would just look me in the eye and tell me how you feel. And hey, if you love me too, it would make me the happiest person in the world to hear you say it.

So, thank you for an amazing six months, I really hope you never find this post, and I love you.

You were my first hero, my first love. You were tall, smart and strong. I never knew a day that I felt safe after she took us away from you.
This morning I gave your wedding photo to your granddaughter. You were so young, handsome and in love. I told her how I was born almost to the day, one year after it was taken. I didn't know you were gone. I only knew that it was August the eighth.

Today is your birthday. As a little girl, I didn't understand the concept of time. I only knew that when your birthday arrived, mine was three weeks away. This will be my first birthday as an orphan, but not my first as a fatherless daughter. 


I hope now you can see that even without the benefits of a parent, I not only survived, but became a woman that any man would be proud to call his daughter. It pains me so greatly that I cannot say the same of you.
I read your obituary, and saw no mention of children.I guess that nobody in your life knew you had any except for sweet Genevieve. She did her best to heal the rift, but the wounds were too deep. I'm grateful that you found her. I only hope that you were good to her. Out of your six wives, my mother included, she was the only one that was a decent human being. I forgive you for being weak and not fighting for, nor, standing by your children. I forgive you for your abdication of your parental role and your complete abandonment. You were weak; I know this. 

I was telling my child how important it was that she knew she was wanted and loved. I explained to her that I feared leaving her with unfinished business and feelings unexpressed between us. We must always work on loving and understanding each other. Little did I know, that this would be a prophetic conversation.

I have known this day was coming. No matter how I prepared, the pain is tremendous. I have googled your name many times. My heart and breath stop momentarily while I reassure myself that you are still alive. Today, on your birthday, there is an obituary. My sister found it. She does the same thing. 

I will miss you, even though I have always missed you. Now, we have no more time. Please give sweet Genevieve my best and tell my grandmother how very much I love her. If you see my dog, Zorba, tell him that I have never loved another canine since he was taken from me when I was sixteen.

I love you, I always have. I can't remember not loving you. I'll always be Daddy's girl. Be happy now, okay?

You're not though. Everyone knows you're not. You're sweet and innocent and caring. You radiate positive energy despite battling crippling depression. You're not a bad person.

Well here is my take on the subject, and while many thoughts may converge, no one will ever know what we had and how special our love is. To me love means that you have found a person who makes you whole. A person who compliments all of your faults with their own strengths. A person who accepts you for you and celebrates all that you are, no matter how kinky, how weird, how sad, how unsure, how broken, how disturbed, how seemingly psychotic you might be and you accept all those things about that person. I am who I am because of you despite the amount of time spent together. I've met many people from numerous walks of life, and not a single one is anything at all like you. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blind and I know you have faults; we all do, that's part of being human. I love your faults. Not ""I love you despite them"", rather I love them. They make you, you... You are every reason, every hope, and every dream, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours forever. You're leaving this place of tension and exhaustion. I feel it. You're going to find me in a place of effortlessness because we left ourselves at the door looking in each others eyes. You are terrible at cleaning, but you are a gourmet chef. You don't need reassurance your simple. I make mistakes and you love me even though I'm imperfect. I saw that you were perfect, so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more. When I need you, you give all of yourself to me until you can't give anymore. You and I developed our love through some incredible sex and it opened our eyes to new possibilities, Ill never forget when we were lying in bed and you reached for me in your sleep telling me you loved me for the first time. We were lucky to have found each other, and there are obstacles and circumstances keeping us apart but we keep going, because you know that without each other, our lives are incomplete. I found the love I want forever and I didn't fight for you, or embrace your faults. Yes, you hurt me and I hurt you but I assure you, no one has ever or will ever come close to what we have. Our time together was short but time is just an illusion. As dusk is an illusion, because the sun is either above the horizon or below it. And that means that day and night are linked in a way that few things are, there cannot be one without the other yet they cannot exist at the same time. How would it feel, I remember wondering to always be together yet forever apart. Because we'll always be a little crooked, a little broken. As feeling creatures in a hard world. We will have to change shape. We will have to adapt. And the constant effort is overwhelming.
Until It becomes a beauty of being alive. It stops being effort when it becomes the exploration of feeling. When it becomes the adventure of what we are capable of. And I can help you rest when you need it. I can give you the space to repair yourself when you need it, then you will find me. And then you will trust that nothing you can ever say will disappoint me-will make me love you less. No expectation of how you should live your life will ever come from me, because I want more than a typical thing. I want our real connection, souls touch that can weather... life. Because its hard and will be. But it's beautiful when it's with you, Only what we care about matters. I love you and I'm able to let you have me. I am able to give you me and not be afraid that you'll break me because I trust you. And we're so beautiful together. And to quote (The Notebook) if in some distant place in the future, we see each other in our new lives, I will smile at you with joy, and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love.
I love you. Ill love you forever.

My friend who I worked with happily offered his brother's room for me to stay in as he has moved out and had the free space available.

When it comes to the day that I come over, all of a sudden your girlfriend came over on the same night, and is uncomfortable with the idea that I'd be staying over the night and declares that I'm not allowed. Now if you had given me prior notice, that would've been fine as I could have found an alternative place to stay. But no. You decide to let me know, twenty minutes after I fucking arrive into the damn city. I had no other place to go, you were aware of this. My friend from university is unreliable and forgot to get the form for guests filled in on time and therefore I wasn't allowed to stay at his student accommodation and you knew this. 

I'm a 19 year old, and fairly small girl, in a city that's known for it's violence and you decide to let me down at 11PM. I was stranded for 2 hours trying to ring up people however the other people I know in the city were either at work or busy and on such short notice, and a lot of hotels were already at full capacity. I was forced to pay PS45 for a hostel/hotel twin room as it was the only single accommodation available within my price range and I did not want to share a dormitory room as I have anxiety when it comes to my belongings. You have the cheek to text me, ask me if I've found a place yet because you can't have me wondering around aimlessly on my own, yet you couldn't get the balls to tell your girlfriend that I had nowhere else to go and it wouldn't be fair to leave me stranded in the first place.

I'm sorry if your girlfriend is worried about the fact that a female would be in your house, but I had no feelings outside of friendship with you. You're the one who hit on me when you were drunk, I refused your offer and you accepted that. The worst thing is you didn't even apologise.

Even when I'm smiling, I can't escape the cavernous void inside me. Even surrounded by people, I can't shake this feeling of perpetual isolation, indefinite loneliness, unshakable unbelonging. I just want you to know, whenever (if ever) I meet you, that you will never understand how grateful I will be for rescuing me from myself. You will never comprehend the significance of your existence in my world. Through all your human flaws, you will be perfected in my eyes. I will never want to let you go, which is an entirely novel feeling for me. I will adore you, wholeheartedly.

And, if you were able to figure me out, you will know that I do not claim such things lightly. Being this close to someone terrifies me. I will be terrified, future happiness. I will be utterly terrified, but entirely ecstatic at the same time, and I will probably want to escape, return to the comforting monotony and predictability of this misery to which I've grown quite accustomed, but I won't because you will make me strong enough to allow myself to feel what I'm feeling without restraint or guilt. 

I will love to love you, I will shout from the top of my lungs for all the world to hear the feelings that I usually encounter with trepidation, with fear and trembling, and with restraint and obscurity. You will make me feel alive for the first time in a very, very long time - possibly for the first time ever. And I will show you this letter, my dearest rescuer, and you will maybe understand a fragment more than you have before, though never to the full extent.

When I say I Love You, know that I do not simply mean that I love you, in the way I love my friends, or in the way that I love a crisp, autumn day. I mean that I cannot picture a world without you - you make the sky bluer, the clouds fluffier, the sun brighter, the air fresher, the flowers more vibrant. You make waking up in the morning an exciting pleasure rather than an inevitable obstacle. You make my stomach churn in the most pleasant of ways. You make me want to throw caution to the wind and escape with you to anywhere, to find reprieve from a suffocating world, though a world infinitely better simply due to the fact that it was the medium through which allowed me to encounter you.  

Though I cannot imagine what this must feel like, Rescuer, and I cannot imagine how many infinities I will have to dredge through until I find you, I look forward to it every day. You are the hope that keeps me alive, and I mean that quite literally. Without you, my future becomes a bleak, meaningless dystopia of erosion and decay. You are quite literally my joie de vivre, and we do not even yet know of each other's existence. 

I wish, with every fiber of my being, for this letter to exist with purpose. 

Please don't keep this floating in the void.

I want so bad to go back, to have you come home to me. I want so bad to have you back. To be able to laugh with you, to pull you close and be ""that couple"" in every store we walk in. Then I think it's possible. In several months, you will be at my door promising me the piece of your heart you held from me for so long. You say you will..

But I'm so scared of that. I'm so scared of waiting for you. Of getting my hopes up for you to come back and be the same person you have been. I'm so scared of you showing back up and making me fall back in love only to find that you've gone back to relaxing with the drug I hate so much and the reassurance of other girls words. I know the people you live with. I know what they're like and what they'll try to talk you into. I don't trust you're strong enough to resist. I'm so terrified of rereading the same story you wrote in the past. Only you can write the sequel, but I'm not sure you have it in you.

I'm trying to wait for you. Yes, I'm branching out and meeting people but I can assure you, I'm keeping it all platonic. I've noticed you've done the same. I only hope you've done the exact same.. Because if you come back, I need you to be sure. Don't come back to tell me it can never happen. If that's the case, if you can't be that person, just stay gone.  Because even though that would destroy me, it would cut less deep than a repeat of history.

 I love you, more than I ever knew was possible in this world. But god damn it, you have to be 100% absolutely sure that you can do what's expected.

They say a man will settle down with whoever he's with when he's ready. You weren't ready, and that's obvious. Maybe you became ready, but it was too late. 

I AM waiting for you, and I will continue to do so. But in six months, you will either come to me with an unbreakable promise, or you better not come to me at all.

And the feeling that overwhelms me and replaces the nervousness is... indescribable. I... I don't even know where to begin to try and explain it... it's like a calmness, but exponentially... a feeling of... safety... butterflies... fuzziness... like someone turned on white noise in my brain and put pop rocks in my chest... all of those things together still doesn't explain half of the feeling. And that feeling lasts for hours... days. Everytime I look at you, that pop rock feeling rushes back... your eyes, your hair, the way you look at me, the look you give me when I say something ridiculous... your smile, your laugh, your voice, even just being next to you... just being in the same room as you... I love everything about you. Sometimes I wish you could hear the things that run through my head when I'm with you or thinking about you... you'd never be self-conscious ever again. That's another reason why I write these... in the hopes that I say it enough to where you finally start to believe it. I've thought you were amazingly beautiful since the moment we met, since that first picture you sent me... and the more I got to know you, the more beautiful I thought you were, because I learned just how beautiful you are on the inside too. And as time went on, I kept falling for you more and more... even now, a year later, I still fall for you a little more. I have to stop myself a lot from saying 'I love you' even though I really want to.



I think I told you this earlier but just so you know... I'm really glad you kissed me yesterday... I can't explain why, but it felt so... fuck, I can't think of the word... commonplace? Easy? ...Natural! It felt so natural... like we've kissed a million times... even though my heart started racing and every muscle felt weak, I didn't feel that nervous anxiety like last time... like something just clicked and it just felt so... right. I wish I would've had the slightest confidence to grab you and pull you against me...kiss you deeper, passionately, more than a quick one...a take-your-breath-away kiss. All I wanted to do was kiss you again... and I know you didnt choose that Grey by accident... and when I realized what episode it was, it made me want to kiss you more and hope even more that you would kiss me again. I would love to just...kiss you... kiss you without intending for it to go much beyond that... like teenagers making out for the first time ever. I almost want to ask you sometimes the night before we have plans if you would mind if I randomly kissed you... then I'd know when I'm able to muster up the confidence/courage to do it, I could just... go for it, for lack of better terms... I just want to know that it's wanted...that *I'm* wanted... 



When I told you the day before that I really didn't expect you to buy me anything and that I just really wanted to see you, that I didn't need presents, I just needed you... I meant it... I meant it with everything I have. And when you said that it was the nicest thing anyone's ever said to you, I got confused for a few minutes because I... I wasn't trying to be cheesy, I was just being completely honest. All the things you've told me about your past relationships baffles me that anyone could treat you like that, that absolutely anyone could possibly NOT treasure you, tell you as often as possible how beautiful and amazing and perfect you are... that's why I try so hard to tell you those things so often, why I try so hard to make you happy. and it's why I said that I'd do everything and anything I possibly can to make up for however long you didn't hear those things, make up for anyone who ever treated you any less than I do, less than you deserve... did you know that sometimes *I* feel like I don't do enough? That I don't deserve you? You're just so amazing and so fucking beautiful... I don't know how in the world I managed to get you, how I managed to keep you... and maybe that's why I worry so much that there's someone else, that you'll realize you could do so much better than *me*... and then I get scared. I get scared because I... I don't know what I'd do without you... even being without you for half a day starts to bother me. I could lose every single person in my life except you and Daniel and I would still be absolutely happy and content. You're the best thing to ever happen to me (besides Daniel)...and I feel *so damn lucky* that you're mine. you have no idea how lucky I feel... I hope you know just how much you mean to me. I hope you really truly know... 



When M&amp;D got back from shopping, she told me that after all the stupid shit and mood swings I've been having (she's stopped by for ~15-20min on her way home from work everyday for the past 2 weeks or so), even though I always have a cheesy smile when I talk *about* you, that it was the first time in a few weeks where I was ""genuinely smiling even when not talking about you"" and I ""seemed like if I had enough room, I'd be frolicking instead if walking.""  It's funny that when I'm with you, no matter how hard I try, I can't keep a straight face... it doesn't even have to do with anything I'm saying, but I always have to try really really hard not to have that cheesy smile constantly...and if I'm telling you something and look up at you, even when I'm being dead serious, I still can't stop myself from smiling.



Out of every woman in the entire world, in the entire universe, even in any parallel universes, I still would never be able to find someone who even comes close to being as stunningly beautiful and perfect for me as you are. All this time... all the time wasted on him... all that time and I finally learned *you* were what I was missing.

""I get upset when your feelings are hurt because it makes me feel like shit""

Words that were spoken before. A sentence that triggers me hard...

""this conversation is over"" only after you've said your piece. 

I've been there. .... done that 


""It's supposed to be easy""


Would have been if an actual conversation ensued. ... not scathing words, then being told I'm arguing and you won't talk more.


So much baggage . I was always bad.  I always argued. You weren't perfect.  I still cared for you.  Still tried to show I'm not a cheat. 

I just liked you too much. Way too much.

Topping from the bottom. Yes it hurt. You pushed me. I wanted to say no sometimes.  I didn't. 

I never liked my underwear in my mouth. You'd never know.  I never said no in the middle.  Never wanted to ruin a scene for you 


Slut. ... I hated  it.....I told you . You kept it up. I took it.


It's supposed to be easy? 

Does that only pertain to you?

Being ""awkward"" I'm there? That hurts.  That isn't an argument.  Anyone who hears ""its awkward to have you around near coworkers"" would feel hurt too.

I'll miss you . I'll miss what I think you could be without the bad ass attitude.  
Maybe I'm wrong. .. but you broke rules for me.... just like I did for you  you..... hated someone could make you weak.  Just like I did.

I wanted you. I know I meant something.  At least I want to think thats it... I wish. 


I only wanted someone to care. 

...someone came out of the woodwork today.....someone I cut contact with for..... reasons.... once you and I talked. It was odd seeing a text from him after weeks of no contact.  No where near you. He's. .... safe. I can say my feelings are hurt without anger...... and he wants me. Flaws, self consciousness and all. 


I hate it. I hate that I won't have someone that really made me happy ... but he's safe. I guess safe is what I need.  Im too old to keep trying. ..



He understands when I'm hurt and let's me talk it out since I don't yell.

 He's vanilla. .... he doesn't play pool.... he goes to bed early. .... but...... he wants me flaws and all...

I guess I deserve it huh? I guess I need to settle.",,False,,t5_2seir,1418327115.0,,,True,t3_2oybw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2oybw9/safe/,

But I want you out of my life. At least for now.

I don't think you even know how much pain you've caused me over the years. You chose that man over me every time, even leaving me homeless for six months so you could ""fix things"". All my life he's put me down, embarrassed and humiliated me, spit on me and threw me against walls, and gone out of his to make my life a living hell, and you've just let it happen. You cost me a happy childhood. I know cutting you out of my life won't bring it back, but with you gone I will be able to heal.

I need to forgive you, but it's going to take time. I need to fill my life with happiness and surround myself with love, because I've never experienced that.

I don't know how you'll react to this note. I don't feel like you'll really process it. You'll just act like everything is normal and immediately take your mind off it. Like you always have.

Goodbye. I love you. I'm sorry.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_2oygx2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2oygx2/a_letter_i_want_to_send_my_mother_after_i_move/,
