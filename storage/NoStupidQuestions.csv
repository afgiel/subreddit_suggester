They might be basic, and it might be that I havent understood some of the parts of evolution correctly, please just tell me if there is anything wrong in this ramble or the questions in **bold**.

The concept of natural selection and mutations seems like such a perfect concept, that after 3.5 billion years of evolution I guess all living things on earth are as great as they can get. **I dont see there existing any other sences or traits a creature could have that is yet to be invented by biology.** If biology could have made us do anything from the Xmen movies, I'd guess 3.5 billion years of evolution would have given it to some of the creatures by now. But instead of that we all have eyes, ears, noses and mouths.

I used to wonder why monkeys still exist if we derived from them, but after goodling that a bit I see why it makes sence that one species could've mutated in two different ways, split up, and then reproduced in those groups etc. But why wouldn't they all together evolve into humans??! It baffles me that a couple of million years hasn't made monkeys and apes more human like. **The evolution logic makes it seem as if they had something huge to gain as a species by staying monkeys.**

This also counts for all other animals. I dont see what it is thats so special about our species and what we derived from that made us value intelligence and walking on two feet more than all the others. When it comes to intelligence, **why hasn't natural selection made all living things ridiculously smart by now?** Just as smart as us. 'Cause I dont see why that would be especially beneficial to us. And I dont see how different types of mutations would be more common with different species, so the speed of evolution should be the same for all living things. 

And when it comes to the speed of evolution, **why does all monkeys/apes look like what we think we've derived from?** Even though they probably have evolved in some way they dont seem as evolved as us. Almost as if the speed of their evolution was slower. 

Since evolution revolves around how the ones with better genes survive and reproduce more, **has evolution stopped for the human race?** First of all we might have a different idea of what good genes are than the our predecessors. Ancient humans might've prefered the greatest and biggest hunters, as we value intelligence more and more, as well as an ability to sit still and look at a screen. Lets say someone was born with a pair of wings, I'd say that was an improvement to the human race, yet he wouldn't have reproduced more or given the other humans a larger competition to get food! He would be seen as a freak, and would maybe get the exact opposite - less jobs and less offspring. Secondarily, we have no natural predators. We all keep on living and reprodusing no matter how great our genes are. Isnt natural predators somewhat of a ""must"" for evolution to take place? Thirdly, studies show that smarter people are having fewer babies and vice versa. And finally, the ones who cant take care of themselves live off the state. So there are few who has any real struggle getting along. Aka no real competition. 

I read somewhere that pandas would be extinct long ago if it wasn't for us liking them so much, and keeping them. **So I guess the human race is changing what evolution is about for all the other species too.** The pigs that would be made to reproduce the most are the fattest, and the animals that are kept from being killed are the cutest.

I totally support this process, I don't feel weird about it at all and we still keep in touch/are as good of friends as ever (if a little less close due to distance and life being busy, you know how it is after high school), but I know that sometimes issues surrounding these topics can be really difficult for everyone. I don't want to inadvertently upset or offend my friend with pre-transition photos... but I think they'd really like to have copies of these photos (because of Andrew's suicide). At the same time I know he's worked hard on, and struggled with his identity. I know Thomas was unhappy in a female body, and never identified with it. It makes me sad Andrew cant see him now,  Thomas is a much stronger, happier, more fulfilled person. I really really don't want to do anything to affect that, or cause mental anguish or emotional pain. I don't want to trigger any bad feelings or experiences...but I do want to share Andrew's memory. 

Is there an established way of 'dealing' with pre transition photo's in the trans community? (I'm sorry I couldn't think how to word that better) Would asking if he wants these photo's be in poor taste, or bad somehow? I know it probably varies greatly from person to person... but I figured I'd ask just in case maybe there is a general attitude or idea about this kind of thing.
