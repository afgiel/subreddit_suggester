1418423954.0,4,self.askphilosophy,2p4de4,Currently there is a hot debate going on in the soccer/football world. Is it possible to form an undeniable (or close to undeniable) conclusion using logical reasoning like Aristotle given this information?,ScalicTotem,4,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2p4de4/currently_there_is_a_hot_debate_going_on_in_the/,"There is a debate going on about who is currently the best soccer player of the calender year.  It is between two players, Messi and Ronaldo (and a third who will be ignored in this argument).  There are a few factors involved here that I will simplify in a way someone that doesn't watch soccer will understand.  Assuming I am being honest with the information below, I would like to know who you think deserves the title of ""best player"".  Also with this information is it possible to state with great confidence or form a good argument that one is better than the other for this calender year?

The best player in the world wins something called the Ballon d'Or.  The one truth to help set up this argument is this; the Ballon d'Or is given to the best individually talented player in the world.  *The most* important thing when picking a winner for this award is individual achievement and skill. After that, team achievement (team trophies) are taken into account to determine who is best.   If there is confusion on this I can expand further.

Given this definition of Ballon d'Or, here are some facts on the two players.

There were four big tournaments this year that both these players competed in; the Champions League, the World Cup, the Spanish League, and the Spanish Cup. 

For club teams (which play in the Champions League, Spanish League, and Spanish Cup), Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Real Madrid while Messi plays for Barcelona.  These two teams can be considered equal when Ronaldo and Messi are excluded from them.  For national teams (World Cup), Ronaldo plays for Portugal while Messi plays for Argentina.  With Ronaldo and Messi excluded from their national teams, Argentina is undoubtedly the better team.  These two facts are important because it's generally accepted that a good player will play better when he is surrounded by good players.  Thus, Messi *should* in theory play better for Argentina than Ronaldo does for Portugal. 

In terms of tournament prestige, it goes: Champions League = World Cup &gt; Spanish League &gt; Spanish Cup.  Some argue the Champions League is more important and some argue the World Cup is.  Both sides have valid arguments so I set their importance as equal.

**The Spanish League, Champions League, and Spanish Cup went from January - May.**  The Champions League is considered the biggest club tournament in the world.

-----
-Neither Real Madrid (3rd) or Barcelona (2nd) won the Spanish League.  The performance of the two teams as a whole can be considered equal. 

-Ronaldo was voted the best player of the Spanish League.  This was not a controversial decision.  Ronaldo (31 goals, 9 assists) performed better than Messi (28 goals, 11 assists).  Both played worse relative to their previous seasons.  Nonetheless, both their seasons, though ""bad"" in comparison to previous seasons, are still better than most top players' best seasons.

-----
-Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the Spanish Cup final.  Neither Messi nor Ronaldo scored in the final.

-Messi scored 5 goals in the tournament and Ronaldo scored 3.

-This is the least important tournament for both teams and players.

-Generally the team that wins this Cup brags while the other plays it off as not important.

-----
-As stated above, the Champions League is considered the biggest club tournament in the world.  Out of World Cup years, individual performance in this tournament plays the biggest factor as to who the best player in the world is.

-Real Madrid won the tournament and the team performance was statistically one of the best ever for any team in the history of the tournament.

-Barcelona was disqualified from the tournament in the quarterfinals, their worst result in years.

-Ronaldo broke the record for most goals scored in the tournament in a single season (17).  The previous record was 14 goals which was set in the 1962-1963 season.  Messi matched this record in 2012 by scoring 14 goals.  Messi won the Ballon d'Or for the year he did this (and not *just* because he did this).  Ronaldo and Messi both took 11 appearances to reach their records.  The amount of goals scored in this tournament the last few years has been the foremost deciding factor as to who deserves the Ballon d'Or.

-Ronaldo was voted the overall best player of the tournament.

-Messi played well below the level he normally did in his Ballon d'Or winning years during the tournament.  Another player scored 10, and Messi scored 8 along with another player but placed 4th because of minutes played taken into consideration (more goals in less minutes = better).

-----
**The World Cup takes place once every 4 years.  The tournament is 1 month long.**  The World Cup is the main reason many are arguing over who should win the Ballon d'Or.  Because the tournament takes place once every 4 years people pay very close attention to performances in it simply because of the prestige and history of the tournament.

-Ronaldo did not perform well with Portugal.  Portugal as a whole was very bad and were knocked out early.  Part of why Ronaldo didn't perform at his best is because he was injured throughout the whole thing - it's up to you to decide whether this matters or not.  He scored 1 goal in the tournament and was not in the discussion when it came to who the best player in the tournament was.  There is no controversy as to whether he played well or not.

-Messi scored 4 goals in the tournament.  The highest goalscorer scored 6, 2nd place was 5 goals, and 3rd place was 4 goals by someone other than Messi (the other player had a better assists/minutes played ratio).  3 players scored 4 goals.

-Argentina (Messi) finished second place in the tournament.

-Messi was voted by FIFA as the best player of the tournament.  This was a *very* controversial decision for many as Argentina did not win the tournament, Messi didn't score the most goals, nor did he make the most assists.  Many say Messi was the easy-way-out for FIFA to give someone the title of best in the tournament and he is undeserving.  Others say Messi is only reason Argentina got to the final which is also disputed.

-It is commonly agreed upon by most that Messi was the best player for Argentina in the tournament.  Two other players are also highly regarded but not to the extent of Messi.

--------

--------


With what is stated above, here are some common observations of the football/soccer community.

Statistically Ronaldo was better from January-May than Messi was from June-July.

Many argue that the months January-May should hold more value as to determining the Ballon d'Or winner because being *exceptionally* good over several months is more impressive than being *exceptionally* good over 1 month.  I would like to know your stance on this argument in particular.

Many argue that because Messi is surrounded by better players for his national team, it's natural that he will do better.  The same people argue that Ronaldo's team (who is generally regarded as less talented than Messi's) severely underperformed, making it even harder for Ronaldo to do well.

-----

With all of this in mind and under the assumption I tried to be fair and honest, who do you think is deserving of Ballon d'Or?  Is it possible to form one of those foolproof Aristotle like arguments to say one is better than the other?
