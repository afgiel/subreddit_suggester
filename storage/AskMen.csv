Basically, earlier this month, I started doing some volunteer work at a cafe/music venue, run by volunteering University students in my city. So far I've only had 1 shift, so I've met like, 2 people.

Anyways, the venue is hosting a free Christmas dinner/party/whatever for all the volunteers, which I plan on attending, since half my reason for signing up was to socialize (moved in the summer, I know basically no-one except for people in my study group). But I realise, I have no fucking clue how to. Once I get talking to someone, basically even if it's just a 3 sentence exchange, I have no problem talking to people. I just have trouble breaking the initial ice.

The main aim of attending this is to socialise, but I am single, so obviously, I wouldn't mind meeting some girls too. Not one-night-stands though, they aren't my type of thing.

So basically, any tips to start talking to a random group of people whom I've never met? There's no saying if the two people I have met will be there.

We had great chemistry, and things were going well. He mentioned before I came over the first time (late September) that he had recently ended a relationship with a live-in girlfriend, and her decorations would still be all over the apartment. I appreciated the honesty and told him so, and there was nothing except his furniture there the next time (two weeks later), which made me feel better.

However, when I was sleeping over one night (about a month after my first visit), I found a bunch of long, dark hairs on the floor, and I do not have long dark hair. I asked him about it, and he wrote it off. I was really uneasy, and I realize that this probably makes me the crazy girl, but I started looking around. Found out from his ex's Instagram and Twitter accounts that she had definitely still been there on multiple occasions. He came over the day I found out, and I explained to him what I had found, why I went looking for it, and I asked him to explain what was going on. She was apparently uninterested in moving out altogether, and would get really emotional whenever he tried to force the issue. He did seem remorseful, and I knew it was his first time ever living with anyone, let alone dealing with that fallout. So, I told him I'd be around while he figured it out.

Five weeks later, she's still not out. He looks defeated and tired but unwilling to remove her--which makes me think that he was still in love with her. So, I told him it was me or her, and that I wasn't going to sleep with him until I knew she was out (we hadn't had sex for over a month at that point, and I suspected that there was definitely something going on with them). 

Suffice it to say, I am not seeing him anymore. I do, however, still receive emails from him saying that he wants to see me and ""love me like there's no tomorrow."" His girlfriend is decorating for Christmas and nesting like there's no tomorrow (I should not know this, but I do), and I don't think she has a clue what happened. 

I did exactly what I needed to do for me, which was to end any involvement with him. But, I have a few questions. (I recently relocated to another country and therefore haven't had a lot of people to talk to about this.)

1) What do you guys think of this guy and his actions?

2) Did I do the right thing by sticking around as long as I did?  

3) Should I have given him an ultimatum? How do guys generally respond to ultimatums? 

4) I wanted to let this slide and let them move on with their lives, but the emails are really bothering me. Should I out him to her?

I have a bit of a problem.  I've been hitting it off with a girl I've know for quite a while, and I'd like to ask her out.  However at the end of next week, the semester ends (we're both college students).  She lives across the States, which makes visiting frankly something I can't afford.

To make things even better, I'm going on co-op for the Spring, about a 4.5 hour drive.  And I don't have a car.  I really don't know if I'll be able to visit, and I doubt she could either.  I wouldn't be seeing her regularly again until next August. 

Do I try to start a relationship long distance?  Do I wait until next fall and hope she hasn't found someone else? I've got about 3 weeks of high school dating as my only experience, I really don't know what I'm doing.  If you've got any advice I'd love to hear it.  Thanks!",,False,,t5_2s30g,False,,,True,t3_2p4cq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2p4cq9/relationship_now_or_later/,

I told her that I don't know for sure.

Which sparked my interest. How did your non-blond girlfriends look like when they went blond from black/brown? I put in blue-eyes since my girlfriend has them, and I feel that eyecolor also has influence whether it will suit her.

In your personal opinion, recommend or not? And state whether it was whiteblond, goldblond, darkblond (picture of a haircolor product as reference).",,False,,t5_2s30g,False,,,True,t3_2p4cmv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2p4cmv/men_with_blackbrown_haired_blueeyed_girlfriends/,

Hi guys,

As a generally physically-unattractive girl with some major body image issues (very overweight and masculine in appearance - think Rosie O'Donnell), I've gotten to age 26 without ever having been in a relationship with a guy. Most of my friends are pretty attractive girls who always seem to get ""approached."" That doesn't ever happen to me and I've accepted that.  It's the way the world works.  That said, the few times (4-5 times total) I've pursued a guy or expressed interest, I've been turned down (""I only see you as a friend... you're like a sister to me, etc...)  
My question is:
as a physically unattractive female,
how do I go about expressing interest in a guy without:

- seeming desperate? (which I imagine is a major turn-off)

- being automatically ""friend-zoned"" becuase of the way I look?

I am part of a popular NYC Theater group. There's about 1500 members in this theater. The theater throws a lot of parties, the holiday party is this week for example and I expect about 200-250 people to attend.

Real quick about my dating background: I've never picked up a stranger in public that led to anything but I do ok online. In 2014 with Okcupid I went on about 40 first dates. I brought home/went home with about 20-22 of these women. So about 50% success rate. When I take a girl out from OKcupid for a drink I give it about 45 minutes in with successful conversation/flirting/touching.. if I'm making her laugh and feel I've connected at about 45 minutes I'll lean in a start kissing her. Make out- more drinks- more laughing half the time I can get them home.
So I've been at a bunch of these parties for this theater over the last 2 years. I have a good time, flirt with beautiful girls, they flirt back I engage with them but I always go home alone. I feel like I can't make my moves in this setting. It can even start to feel like a date if just me and one girl are locked in on each other for a while but I always think, ""well she didn't agree to go on a date with me we are just at this party together"". And everyone is here and anyone can see us and no one else is making out. SO how can I make any moves in this situation? How can I take a girl home from this event? I can think of about 6 who will be there that I'm dying to get. I have tried in the past towards the end of the night or when people start to leave to get the girl to go to another bar/location with me but I always get, ""I'm tired, I have to work tomorrow, I have to get to bed"" etc..

Any tips?! I really need them. Going home alone from these parties is starting to crush my spirit.
