I will provide a few points on why I think it is appropriate to bring up context but please don't just limit your responses to these points:

1) In life, we consider everything in context (conversations, books, movies, body language), so why not religious texts?

2) The content of any information can be changed easily by removing context. Thus, if we want to consider what religious texts are ACTUALLY communicating, we should do it in context.

(Psychology, psychiatry, etc)",Impractical_Luggage,6,0,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2p3pbw/how_does_one_balance_religious_belief_with/,"TL;DR: When mind and soul come to clash, what is it that must go to smash?

Many people regardless of religious belief that the scientific process is generally the best way to determine probable truth. Space ships, iphones, and extremely precise prediction give tangible evidence anyone can see. The problem is that this isn't a binary: there may be some topic that one believes is better approached using some other method. Science here, religion or philosophy there. In practice this can make for practitioners that are very effective in their own field or some element of it, but hold dubious positions in others.

This works better in some fields than others: most people's beliefs aren't sincerely challenged by natural history because it's mostly about rocks rolling around, animals being animals, and inanimate energy flow (weather, heat from the Sun and Earth's core, etc.) People aren't present in most of this picture, and people's truly important beliefs revolves around people and their interactions.

What about psychology? Religious views seem to be greatly psychological in their claims: the whole salvation narrative is such, Buddhism is about suffering, a psychological subject, and even the vague ""spirituality"" seems to be pointing in such a direction. If one has non-scientific views of how human minds fundamentally work, what is prevent that from being translated into fundamental errors in their practice?

This isn't merely an academic issue with no consequences to be taken lightly. The consequences are real. There's 600,000 social workers in America with immense power over vulnerable people, as well as psychologists and psychiatrists. I've directly seen religion (buddhism in one instance, Christianity in two others) recommended as part of treatment by people with PhD's. To me, this is as unacceptable as a medical doctor promoting homeopathy as a cure for a cancerous tumor. In addition twelve-step programs (which are based on pseudoscience and are basically reframed Christianity with a plausibly-deniable ""higher power"" everyone knows is God) are advocated by nearly everyone with a job in my county's mental healthcare system.

One's personal beliefs are fine, but _don't offer them as medicine in any way_, which includes psychological treatment.

What is a patient to do? Become a literal scientist to determine what's supported by research and what's based on complete hogwash? (good luck navigating the ocean of bad advice on the internet and research papers on your own) How is someone with serious mental health conditions, who needs this help the most, supposed to navigate such an insane system?

You are shown a microscope slide of a snowflake. You immediately notice that it is radially symmetrical, geometrically intricate, and upon viewing other examples, that no two are alike. 

To you, this is obvious proof of some sort of intelligent unseen artist, sculpting each snowflake as it falls to Earth. How could something so complex and beautiful just happen by itself?

However, the snowflake's hexagonal radial symmetry is a macro scale expression of the hexagonal bond formed by water atoms when they crystallize at sufficiently low temperatures. Each water molecule is comprised of three parts; one hydrogen, two oxygen. When a bunch of them undergo covalent bonding at low temps, you get a hexagonal lattice, like chickenwire but three dimensional. This is why the larger snowflake is hexagonally configured.

The fractal layout is a typical result of natural processes acting on matter in such a way as to accumulate complexity against some sort of resistance. These patterns also appear under other circumstances but are always a dead giveaway that the object in which they appear is procedural in origin. 

No two are alike because snowflakes fall through fleeting pockets of colder and warmer air as they descend, which accelerates and slows down the freezing process, respectively. The temperature fluctuation each snowflake experiences as it falls to earth is unique, hence the resulting snowflake is unique. 

""Ah, but God made the atoms/natural processes/etc."" is the same error in reasoning carried up a level. 

But, how does the structure of a snowflake teach us anything about the origins of living things? The key is their fractal structure. Fractals appear all over the place in nature. So do fibonnaci spirals, for related reasons. Wherever an optimizing process like evolution selected for efficiency of electrical or fluid distribution, for example, the result will always be fractal. Your central nervous system, your veins and arteries, your lungs, trees, ferns, the veins on leaves and so on. Fibonnaci spirals appear in living things where efficiency of growth was selected for (snail shells, your cochlea, pinecones, pineapples, the head of a sunflower, aloe plants, etc.) and in nonliving things shaped by rotation (hurricanes, spiral galaxies, tornados, etc.)

This is indeed a type of design, but design performed by a simple optimizing process, not an intelligent being. Intelligently engineered objects like microchips, cars, airplanes and so on are also very complex, but it's a distinctly different type of complexity. Once you know what to look for, you can tell the two apart very easily, even if it's something you've never encountered before.

The end result of optimizing processes, which are themselves exceedingly simple, can nonetheless be mind bogglingly complicated if the process has been working on it for a very, very long time. Start with anything that can make copies of itself with occasional errors, apply selective pressure, and in a billion years or so you'll have critters of some sort. Possibly ones capable of understanding how they got to be so complex.

""Ah, but how can you get something capable of self-copying without an intelligent designer? That's like putting the pieces of a watch in a bag, shaking it up and getting a completed watch!"" Or the ""tornado in a junkyard"" thought experiment, both staples of creationist apologetics. 

The people who say this usually have never heard of prebiotic evolution, so when they say ""watch"", they have the completed animal cell in mind. Each cell in your body is indeed astonishingly complicated and I fully agree it would be absurd to suggest that one of them spontaneously formed. But, that isn't what happened and it's a misrepresentation of abiogenesis. 

Life did not begin with cells. Or even with DNA. It began with the simplest possible chemical reaction that churns out copies of itself. These can be very simple indeed to the point where it's entirely plausible for one to self-assemble by chance under the right conditions, as the snowflake does. 

Once you have something, however rudimentary, which can self copy with occasional errors and selective pressures to cull useless or detrimental mutations, evolution can happen. But, this is still just a precursor to RNA. Where does the rest of the cell come from? 

As it turns out, the bi-lipid membranes of animal cells can be shown to form spontaneously in any lipid-rich solution that you saturate with gas bubbles; Because lipids are hydrophilic on one end and hydrophobic on the other they self-orient in an organized film on the surface of the bubble.   

When the gas escapes (because pressure changes and it dissolves back out) the lipid shell remains. It's easy to see how a prebiotic ancestor of DNA could become trapped in such a bi-lipid membrane and gain a reproductive advantage from that protection.  

Mitochondria are another element of modern cells that we know the origin of. They're single celled organisms themselves, with their own DNA. They used to be an independent organism that at some point became a symbiotic part of the little ecosystem inside animal cells. 

Far from a ""tornado in a junkyard"" or ""pieces of watch in a bag"" concept where they have to magically assemble every molecule into a complete cell, it's more like a series of easy accidental steps where each builds on the last, like a thief guessing one digit of a combination lock at a time and hearing a click that confirms he can move onto the next as opposed to guessing all of the digits in one try.  
  
The ""click"" in this case was the fact that each modification made the precursors to modern cells slightly more durable and successful at making copies, giving them enough of an advantage over the rest of the population to completely replace it over time. The rare cases where this occurred, where the modification was beneficial instead of detrimental, were ""locked in"" because it increased the reproductive success of that replicator to where it could out-compete replicators without that mutation as well as ones with mutations that hindered them, until it became the new normal.  
  
Each time this happened, the descendants of the replicator with the beneficial mutation would gradually replace the rest by attrition until it was the norm. This is just evolution by natural selection on the scale of microorganisms, we directly observe this all the time in the lab because they live, reproduce and die rapidly enough that for them evolution is rapid enough for human beings to witness in the span of a few months or years instead of millions.  
  
All I am telling you that's news to your ears, if I've gauged your level of understanding correctly, is that this rapid process of natural selection also acts on chemical replicators much simpler than DNA or even RNA, which are far from being what science defines as life. So in fact you don't need the spontaneous formation of DNA to get life from non-life. You just need any chemical reaction that makes copies of itself, plus natural selection, plus time.

You also mentioned the sun and the moon as examples you believe allow no possible explanation other than a deliberately engineered universe. If you're referring to their shape, gravity causes mass to assume a more or less spherical form over time. Gravity also accounts for said masses settling into stable orbits. 

The universe can appear very hospitable to life, if you live on Earth. In the same way that the world appears to be a luxurious playground if you live in a gated wealthy community. The universe is on the whole 99.99999999999999999999999999% immediately lethal to us due to extremes of temperature, pressure and radiation. It looks very much like the debris from an explosion, congealed by gravity into spheroids, orbiting the embers of that blast. Not a massive habitat designed with biological organisms in mind. 

To look at the Earth itself and think ""wow, everything is designed for us! We can breathe the air, the temperature is just right, etc. etc. etc."" is backwards reasoning. We fit the Earth because evolution adapted us to it, the Earth was not designed for us.

It comes down to one simple fact- I want my home to be a Muslim home, and I want it to be a place where I can practice my faith in peace and support.


Could I achieve this with a non-Muslim? Certainly, but there is no doubt to me that it would be much harder. Why? I would be asking this person to give up things for me to help me create my happy home rather than our home being something for the both of us. 


I don't drink and don't want alcohol in the house. This applies to smoking and drugs plus swine or non-halal (islam version of kosher) meat. I am able to live in a house that has those things, as I did for many years prior to my marriage, but my preference is to not have it as it makes me practice my faith with ease. 


Secondly, I want someone to fast with. One of the most bonding moments I have with my husband is when he wakes me up to eat pre-dawn meal during ramadan. It's special to me. Could I do this with a non-Muslim? Yes, as I have done the fast with non-Muslim flatmates before who wanted to try it out. Again though this is asking someone to do something for me though, rather than their own self. It is full of asking and not giving in return. 


Yet at the same time I do not want my husband to follow our religion in the same style as me as that is simply not possible. We shall change as we age, and we may become more inclined to some aspects and less inclined to others. I just want us to be... comfortable about each other as we aren't ""the other"" to each other but rather both ""muslims"" and the diversity that statement implies. 


I have been married for almost a year now and this idea has become solid within me. Maybe it would be different if we lived in a Muslim-majority nation, but we don't nor do we want to. We really adore living in America, especially since it has been our home since our births, and all the diversity we find here. I personally feel America is actually the best place to be a Muslim, and yes you can ask me why in the comments. I just want our home to be our lil corner of Islamic culture and religion, a place we can both return to after a day with the outside world that may not understand our needs and wants as it relates to our religion.

We have faith in our senses, in expert authority, in the honesty of people around us, etc.  This doesn't imply any alternative method to acquiring knowledge.

So what about this other usage of faith?  I don't mean the often touted ""belief without evidence"" since it's obviously an over simplification.  Plantinga refers to it as ""a special gift from God, not part of our ordinary epistemic equipment.""  Sean Carroll claims that ""Plantinga is clearly trying to separate 'faith' from merely 'things we would like to believe are true' -- faith is knowledge that is put directly into our minds by God.""*  This notion is internally consistent, but I think, once you reach this point, you've moved away from what constitutes sufficient justification for knowledge.  It's become a tautology: ""I know God exists, because God planted the knowledge of God in my mind.""

Furthermore, in the everyday sort of knowledge, we more or less come to the same conclusions.  We can all agree on the existence of everyday objects, but when it comes to a religious claim, a religious person will sudden have very different justifications.  Why is this novel epistemic equipment given from God only used to evaluate very specific claims?

I think partially it stems from a post-hoc justification of already held beliefs.  The knowledge wasn't *formed* via this special faculty, but instead used to defend knowledge acquired via cultural transmission (i.e. raised in a religious setting etc.)  Likely, ""belief in belief"" a term coined by Daniel Dennett is also in play: in situations where it is difficult to really *believe* something, it is much easier to believe one *ought* to believe something.  So for instance, doubt can be vanquished by upholding faith as a virtue, that one *ought* to have faith.

tldr: My broad argument is that religious people and non-religious people have the same basic means of acquiring knowledge, yet religious people then form exceptions without sufficient justification for their religious beliefs.

Denial of the Holocaust does not require us to deny the entire fields of science including radiometric dating, geology, plate tectonics, and cosmology. YEC does.

And perhaps you *fervently wish* that other religious people would share your approach.

But as a matter of sociological fact, don't real-world religions constantly make claims about the very natural world studied by scientists through empirical observations? For example, a foundational claim of Mormonism is that Native Americans are descended from the lost tribes of Israel, and when DNA research began to disprove this claim, Mormons and their professional apologists took that very seriously and are still trying their best to resolve this conflict with science. Here's a clear case where a religion doesn't just wander into the sphere of science, it was *born* there, and it still *lives* there! Mormons certainly can't ignore the conflict with science, as if they occupied 'different spheres', not without changing their whole religion.

Take a look around the world. Do Jews, Christians, Rastafarians, Muslims, Zoroastrians, Baha'is, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists, Jainism, Confucianists, Taoists, and Shintoists all scrupulously refrain from ever mixing their religion with empirical claims? Do they never make claims about history or the origins of humanity or the origins of the universe central to their doctrine? Quite the contrary.

I can see how you can get ""personal"" even though I dont agree with it. And through the logic of the argument, I can see how ""beginningless"" is attributed as its supposed to be the first cause. Of course the ""powerful"" bit is obvious if youre following the argument. Where I take issue is the ""changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless"" part and I have two objections that Id like settled if you dont mind as this is purely for understanding the approach.

Objection 1:

It would seem that ""changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless"" are attributes of something that wouldnt exist. 

* Immaterial, would seem like something at most ghost-like.

* Spaceless, to me would translate to ""volumeless"". At most gaseous would be what comes to mind but even that has volume technically.

* Timeless, could reasonably translate to ""outside of time"" or ""not effected by time"". If this line of logic is contingent upon everything having a cause and and the uncaused cause being the end of it. In order for it to cause, it would have to be effected by time or when it intervenes it would have to ""enter"" time so to speak.

* Changeless, would mean that it couldnt actually act on anything. Of course this does support as Ive learned from this subreddit the view of freewill. However, this is probably one of the biggest contradiction I can see. **If the entity is changeless, then it cannot act on anything, thus cannot cause anything either.**

Objection 2:

Just a minor objection. How were these attributes arrived at/concluded?
