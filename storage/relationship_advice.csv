Using a throwaway because I am not sure if I can curb my bad language and I want to get everything out here. 

My husband is a wonderful person. Seriously, he puts me to shame in his patience and love. But recently I have been really frustrated by something, or someone, in our life and it is making me have a very difficult time respecting him. I feel like if you ask most men (and some women), respect is something they very much want from their spouse. This is why I feel bad. 

Okay, story time.  

My husband has a friend, let's call her Sally. Sally is married to a guy let's call him Tom. Sally has known my husband for over ten years. They are not what I would call ""close"" but they are friends.  Once a week, all three of them (along with some others) meet up to talk about God. This is not my scene right now and I don't really enjoy a majority of their company, so I don't attend and this is fine. But my husband is often saying, ""Sally really wishes you would come."" or ""Sally really wants to have you over for movies.""

[Let's stop for a moment- if Sally wants these things, why doesn't Sally contact me directly?]

Sally does not have a  lot of close friends. Sally is what I would call ""toxic"". Sally likes to gossip, say mean things and try to make people feel sorry for her. She has a common medical condition which she falls back on in terms of pity. [Sorry, I know people who have cancer that aren't total dicks.]  However, I feel sorry for her and try to hang out with her when my husband suggests. 

For some reason, Sally likes to say rude things to me. Often. Little jabs that she covers with a cunt-like laugh. I am unsure if she thinks cruelty is funny or just doesn't know what a joke is. She says things like, ""Yeah you're not very good at that,"" or ""I don't understand why you're dating him, you seem way cooler."" (when we were dating). 
This is not how I joke. I don't understand humor like this and that's okay, I don't think I would ever want to say just plain mean things about people and think it was the pinnacle of humor. 

However, because she is friends with my husband and because I don't want to ruin their friendship, and they see each other weekly, I have remained silent. I love him and do not want to cause him pain. 

However, this past week I ran into them and we talked about real estate, how my husband and I planned on upgrading. She asked where, and I said, ""Oh a townhouse in ________."" She gives that bitch laugh and goes, ""Well obviously not a house, I mean how much was (husband's) actual last raise?"" 

What. The. Fuck. 

And her spineless husband just stands there like this is an okay thing to say to someone. 

[note: We can afford a house, I just don't want a giant mortgage.]
After a week of deliberating I finally decided to say something to my husband. When I told him of all the awful things she said, (Mostly directed at him) and how much it upset me all he did was look a little surprised and nod. 

""I don't get upset by things like that."" he responded.  

Totally fair. I mean, this guy is secure and that's great.

 But when I expressed how I felt, that it made ME uncomfortable that she said these things, that I was embarrassed when she made fun of him, that it put ME in a bad situation he said nothing. He shrugged. 
""She's never said anything bad to me.""

When I pointed out that actually she had several times in my presence, he just said she was joking. When I told him of the latest thing she said, he went. ""Yeah, that's rude."" 

Yet he plans on continuing to hang out with them weekly. 

Men. Please explain this to me. Explain how someone can insult you, insult you behind your back to your wife and you still don't care. For real. For me however, friends don't talk about friends like that... I don't understand. How can you want to spend time with someone like that? 

I said I didn't want to be involved with her in any way - no more hanging out, etc. He said that was fine, but he was still going to hang out with them within the context of their once-a-week hangout. 
I am having a hard time because I think the biggest issue is I feel like I cannot respect my husband. I feel I cannot respect a man who lets people talk shit about him and just shrug his shoulders. I feel like I should -but (TO ME) there is something unappealing about a man who won't stand up for himself or his family. Maybe it's just how I was raised. I haven't told him this, but I can feel myself pulling away from him. 

Reddit, you don't know me, you don't have to like me - therefore, I would like to hear your opinions. How do I get past this? Am I a total jerk for not wanting to hang out with someone who is rude about my husband and myself?!  Am I horrible for not respecting his decision? 

I guess, if I am a jerk (and I'm open to that possibility) how can I move past this?

It's been a few years since the spilt. The relationship was disfunctional on many levels. The mom is not in a position to be able to provide for herself or the kids. Never has been, (its not a lazy issue, or health issue) although the direct result is severe debilitating depression, some subsance issues. Nothing I do or say can seem to turn it around either. The behavior the attidue displayed she clearly feels hopless. I dont have the finances to help her and live my life. 

Shes been a major factor in all my failed attempts to have any relationship with anyone else since the split, both directly, &amp; inderectly. Shes hostile to the idea of me being with anyone else. Any other female being around our children has been met with threats. Any previous attempts to discuss these issues have been met with spite words, lashing out avoiding the topic, periods of no contact, hysterical crying etc. 

Been a few years of dealing with this. I need to tell her that I want to move on in a healthy manor. I cannot allow this to continue to hold me as a person back. It has taxed me, &amp; the children so much. She cannot interfere with any of my future relationships it seriously has effected me in many more ways that I have recently came to realize. Im pretty sure the original split wasnt resolved correctly. 

So I have managed to get her to agree to a long serious talk about all of this to work something out. I need her to wake up and change some things, &amp; if she doesnt... my only other options are to walk away entirely, really let her hit rock bottom in hopes that smething comes about. Her reaction to that could be extremly volatile. 

Im sure the advice here would be counceling, but I cant afford it, &amp; I feel as though why should I continue to try and fix this person? At what poinht is enough enough, &amp; I have to go my own way.

We had a beautiful little girl together and things seemed to be going really great between us. Then she tells me that she isn't in love with me anymore. At first her reason was that there was no reason, she just fell out of love with me gradually. Then after a fee long talks we realized that it had more to do with the fact that we became so focused on surviving that we forgot about each other. 

I asked her what she thought we could do to work on things and she said nothing. That there wasn't anything to fix, nothing to fight for. But if her feelings on the matter (and me) changed, I would be the first to know. Now at first this is where I thought ""this sucks, but if I move out/on maybe she'll realize how big of a mistake she's making"". Then I found the love note from a coworker.

Apparently this guy she's worked with for a few years now has had feelings for her for awhile. And after hearing of our breakup, jumped all over it. Basically, not even a month later, she's already seeing someone else. And the pain is killing me. She swears up and down that she didn't leave me for him. "" its just really shitty timing, I'm sorry"" "" if I could go back and change it I would"". And I also get gems like ""I promise I won't shove it in your face"" and then leaves me at home with our daughter for 2 hours every day while she goes out for coffee with him. Or takes a phone call from him while we're in the middle of a serious conversation and acts like I'm not even there.

I've poured my heart out to this woman, I've begged, I've yelled, I've shown complete indifference towards her. I've tried doing everything in my power to save what we used to have. She even admits to missing it. Neither of us can remember any of the bad, only the good. But she doesn't want me. She's moved on to someone else and I'm stuck in this apartment watching her fall without a damn thing I can do about it.

I have no friends or family nearby that I can turn to. No money saved up to move. I've been out of work for 2 weeks for medical reasons and as a result won't even see a paycheck for another 3 weeks. I just don't know what to do.

I want to move on, to stop hurting. But everything going on around me seems to make that impossible. Seeing her fall for someone else is killing me. I want to hate her, but all I can do is think of all the wonderful things we had. This is the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and she's single handedly destroying my world.

My parents made me go to church every time the doors were unlocked, and our whole lives revolved around it. In that religion, women aren't allowed to wear makeup, cut their hair, wear jewelry other than a wedding ring, and had to wear long, loose dresses or skirts. Their clothing had to completely disguise their figure, or else, in my dad's words, they were ""dressed like a whore.""

My wife and I left that church a while after getting married, and I've been attacked pretty viciously by my mother about it on a couple of occasions. My dad is just a follower, in every aspect of his life. He does what his wife tells him, what his pastor tells him, what his boss tells him, and he questions nothing. My wife wears makeup and jewelry and pants, so I'm sure he has said she looks like a prostitute, although not around me.

I still love my parents, they're not bad people. I would like to have a relationship with them, and for my kids to. The problem is, they will not move a single muscle to foster a relationship. They rarely call, never invite us over, never come to visit. If my kids have a birthday party, they will show up and stay for maybe 30 minutes, then they have to leave on some pressing business. My mother is retired and has nothing to do, yet she's always so busy she doesn't have time for anything. 

I'd like your opinion on what my duties are toward keeping a relationship with my parents. If I go for a few weeks without calling them, my dad will call me and ask me what they did to make me mad. He'll say ""it seems like you're unhappy with us about something. What can we do to make this right?"" I've told them how I feel, but nothing changes. No visits, no phone calls, no anything. I get tired of being the one to put forth all the effort. If I didn't call them or go visit them, we would just never talk, because I'm the one who does everything. 

A large part of the problem lies with their loyalty to their church. They know I had a falling out with that church and that pastor and left there, but they have never reached out to me or even been open to an explanation as to what happened, and what my wife and I have gone through with it. If we say anything they only hear that we're talking bad about their pastor, and they get very angry and defensive. So that subject is basically taboo, yet their entire life revolves around it, so that leaves a situation where they are always talking about church stuff, but we're pretty much not allowed to comment on it.

They've never abused me like you would normally think of that word--not physically, they've never called me stupid or told me I was worthless or anything--but they make me feel that way, and feel abused. The whole situation with them makes me continually unhappy, and I feel like the only option I'm left with, since I can't change them, is to change myself, and reduce my involvement with them to almost nothing. I don't want to have any regrets after they die, but I need to be fair to myself, and not pursue a relationship that essentially makes me miserable.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_2p3j4r,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p3j4r/36m_parents_wont_make_any_effort_to_foster_a/,

We met on a 1 month high school trip to Europe. I was also her first love. We were very emotionally involved for 3+ years. She's from the Northeast and I'm from the Midwest. We got to spend very little time together but I had never been so invested in someone or never cared for someone so much. She changed me and I wouldn't be who I am today without her.

I think about her mostly all day every day. We keep in contact via a few texts here and there and our relationship ended on mutual terms because of where we were at in life.  We both said, ""Hey, maybe in the future it could work out."" So there wasn't any real closure and I just find myself constantly wondering if she is thinking about me too. 

I've been in a couple other meaningful relationships since we broke up, but none of them ever worked out.  I think its mostly due to the fact that she set the bar so so so very high. My standards have been raised. It's moderately depressing, sometimes. I feel kind of apathetic about pursuing new relationships nowadays because they've been flops since her.

I think I've moved on in some ways, but definitely not in ways that foster me forgetting about her or caring about her any less.  It's pretty clear that I'm still in love with her though, and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm 22 years old and I just graduated from college in May. I met my boyfriend of a little more than 2 years in school. Things were really fun when we were a couple just living and dating on campus, when we only needed to care about going to class, doing schoolwork, etc. 


Now we're living in different states (only about 90 minutes away, but still) and I have a job 5 days a week, 9-5. We don't see each other nearly as much as we used to, not even close. We can only make time on the weekend to see each other. To add to that, he's a very strict Jew and he can't be in cars/travel from Friday night to Saturday night-- actually, I should rephrase, he can't let his very Jewish mother see him traveling in a car on Friday nights/Saturdays. He had no problem traveling on these days when we were in school. When I do visit, we're cooped up in his house until Saturday night and by the end, the weekend is essentially over. (I usually go back home early Sunday afternoon) I admit I complain a lot about this; he calls me selfish and, if he's especially mad that day, an Anti-Semite. I try to be very respectful of his religion and therefore this ""rule,"" but I can't imagine doing this for the next how many months/years when I work all week and the weekends are all I have to do anything fun or social. 


Also, he doesn't know how to drive. I've been asking him to learn how to drive for months now and he always has a new excuse, usually defaulting to ""nobody can drive me to the DMV"" or, when I ask him to take his test on the weekend, ""I can't be in a car on the weekends."" I am sick of being the only one to ever drive anywhere and I've told him this, and he just calls me selfish for it. 


We fight a lot, A LOT. I think I try to break up with him a couple of times per month. We have these explosive arguments and we both say horrible, awful things to each other. But he never stops calling, never stops texting. He manipulates my feelings, tells me I only feel like I want to break up with him for this reason or that reason, but it's never actually because of him. He tells me my feelings aren't real; I'm just overemotional and overdramatic. He says to me, ""why would you rather be alone than with someone who loves you?"" He breaks down, sobs, screams, threatens to hurt himself. He convinces me every time; I have taken him back every time. I know I can be overemotional and I can be rash, but I don't think this is right at all... I've told him sometimes relationships just don't work out and we all have to deal with breakups, but he assures me that because he still wants to be in the relationship, the relationship can't be over. He says that he gets to have a legitimate opinion of whether or not I want to break up with him, it's not just me who can decide if we should break up. 


I really feel like I should leave him, but I know we have good times &amp; I generally enjoy being with him when we're finally together... I just have a problem seeing a future with him and I'm not sure how much longer I can stand things the way they are. I have a laundry list of ""problems"" with us and I don't think that's normal. But, I'm also incredibly lonely and he really is my only friend and the only person I talk to regularly. I know if I break up with him, I'll have nobody to talk to anymore.

Using a throwaway because I am not sure if I can curb my bad language and I want to get everything out here. 

My husband is a wonderful person. Seriously, he puts me to shame in his patience and love. But recently I have been really frustrated by something, or someone, in our life and it is making me have a very difficult time respecting him. I feel like if you ask most men (and some women), respect is something they very much want from their spouse. This is why I feel bad. 

Okay, story time.  

My husband has a friend, let's call her Sally. Sally is married to a guy let's call him Tom. Sally has known my husband for over ten years. They are not what I would call ""close"" but they are friends.  Once a week, all three of them (along with some others) meet up to talk about God. This is not my scene right now and I don't really enjoy a majority of their company, so I don't attend and this is fine. But my husband is often saying, ""Sally really wishes you would come."" or ""Sally really wants to have you over for movies.""

[Let's stop for a moment- if Sally wants these things, why doesn't Sally contact me directly?]

Sally does not have a  lot of close friends. Sally is what I would call ""toxic"". Sally likes to gossip, say mean things and try to make people feel sorry for her. She has a common medical condition which she falls back on in terms of pity. [Sorry, I know people who have cancer that aren't total dicks.]  However, I feel sorry for her and try to hang out with her when my husband suggests. 

For some reason, Sally likes to say rude things to me. Often. Little jabs that she covers with a cunt-like laugh. I am unsure if she thinks cruelty is funny or just doesn't know what a joke is. She says things like, ""Yeah you're not very good at that,"" or ""I don't understand why you're dating him, you seem way cooler."" (when we were dating). 
This is not how I joke. I don't understand humor like this and that's okay, I don't think I would ever want to say just plain mean things about people and think it was the pinnacle of humor. 

However, because she is friends with my husband and because I don't want to ruin their friendship, and they see each other weekly, I have remained silent. I love him and do not want to cause him pain. 

However, this past week I ran into them and we talked about real estate, how my husband and I planned on upgrading. She asked where, and I said, ""Oh a townhouse in ________."" She gives that bitch laugh and goes, ""Well obviously not a house, I mean how much was (husband's) actual last raise?"" 

What. The. Fuck. 

And her spineless husband just stands there like this is an okay thing to say to someone. 

[note: We can afford a house, I just don't want a giant mortgage.]
After a week of deliberating I finally decided to say something to my husband. When I told him of all the awful things she said, (Mostly directed at him) and how much it upset me all he did was look a little surprised and nod. 

""I don't get upset by things like that."" he responded.  

Totally fair. I mean, this guy is secure and that's great.

 But when I expressed how I felt, that it made ME uncomfortable that she said these things, that I was embarrassed when she made fun of him, that it put ME in a bad situation he said nothing. He shrugged. 
""She's never said anything bad to me.""

When I pointed out that actually she had several times in my presence, he just said she was joking. When I told him of the latest thing she said, he went. ""Yeah, that's rude."" 

Yet he plans on continuing to hang out with them weekly. 

Men. Please explain this to me. Explain how someone can insult you, insult you behind your back to your wife and you still don't care. For real. For me however, friends don't talk about friends like that... I don't understand. How can you want to spend time with someone like that? 

I said I didn't want to be involved with her in any way - no more hanging out, etc. He said that was fine, but he was still going to hang out with them within the context of their once-a-week hangout. 
I am having a hard time because I think the biggest issue is I feel like I cannot respect my husband. I feel I cannot respect a man who lets people talk shit about him and just shrug his shoulders. I feel like I should -but (TO ME) there is something unappealing about a man who won't stand up for himself or his family. Maybe it's just how I was raised. I haven't told him this, but I can feel myself pulling away from him. 

Reddit, you don't know me, you don't have to like me - therefore, I would like to hear your opinions. How do I get past this? Am I a total jerk for not wanting to hang out with someone who is rude about my husband and myself?!  Am I horrible for not respecting his decision? 

I guess, if I am a jerk (and I'm open to that possibility) how can I move past this?

I'm not sure if that was a date and I guess at the moment it doesn't matter. I know that I like him and would like to go on an actual date with him/make intentions for clear... Do I wait for him to ask me? Or do I come out and ask him? He's also detached from the people in my life (friends, family) so I feel like there's little risk for awkwardness if it goes badly...

It's been a few years since the spilt. The relationship was disfunctional on many levels. The mom is not in a position to be able to provide for herself or the kids. Never has been, (its not a lazy issue, or health issue) although the direct result is severe debilitating depression, some subsance issues. Nothing I do or say can seem to turn it around either. The behavior the attidue displayed she clearly feels hopless. I dont have the finances to help her and live my life. 

Shes been a major factor in all my failed attempts to have any relationship with anyone else since the split, both directly, &amp; inderectly. Shes hostile to the idea of me being with anyone else. Any other female being around our children has been met with threats. Any previous attempts to discuss these issues have been met with spite words, lashing out avoiding the topic, periods of no contact, hysterical crying etc. 

Been a few years of dealing with this. I need to tell her that I want to move on in a healthy manor. I cannot allow this to continue to hold me as a person back. It has taxed me, &amp; the children so much. She cannot interfere with any of my future relationships it seriously has effected me in many more ways that I have recently came to realize. Im pretty sure the original split wasnt resolved correctly. 

So I have managed to get her to agree to a long serious talk about all of this to work something out. I need her to wake up and change some things, &amp; if she doesnt... my only other options are to walk away entirely, really let her hit rock bottom in hopes that smething comes about. Her reaction to that could be extremly volatile. 

Im sure the advice here would be counceling, but I cant afford it, &amp; I feel as though why should I continue to try and fix this person? At what poinht is enough enough, &amp; I have to go my own way. I feel morally confilicted this is the mother of mychildren, but my own wellbeing is at stake, &amp; at the end of the day I need to be okay for my family. not for her.

We had a beautiful little girl together and things seemed to be going really great between us. Then she tells me that she isn't in love with me anymore. At first her reason was that there was no reason, she just fell out of love with me gradually. Then after a fee long talks we realized that it had more to do with the fact that we became so focused on surviving that we forgot about each other. 

I asked her what she thought we could do to work on things and she said nothing. That there wasn't anything to fix, nothing to fight for. But if her feelings on the matter (and me) changed, I would be the first to know. Now at first this is where I thought ""this sucks, but if I move out/on maybe she'll realize how big of a mistake she's making"". Then I found the love note from a coworker.

Apparently this guy she's worked with for a few years now has had feelings for her for awhile. And after hearing of our breakup, jumped all over it. Basically, not even a month later, she's already seeing someone else. And the pain is killing me. She swears up and down that she didn't leave me for him. "" its just really shitty timing, I'm sorry"" "" if I could go back and change it I would"". And I also get gems like ""I promise I won't shove it in your face"" and then leaves me at home with our daughter for 2 hours every day while she goes out for coffee with him. Or takes a phone call from him while we're in the middle of a serious conversation and acts like I'm not even there.

I've poured my heart out to this woman, I've begged, I've yelled, I've shown complete indifference towards her. I've tried doing everything in my power to save what we used to have. She even admits to missing it. Neither of us can remember any of the bad, only the good. But she doesn't want me. She's moved on to someone else and I'm stuck in this apartment watching her fall without a damn thing I can do about it.

I have no friends or family nearby that I can turn to. No money saved up to move. I've been out of work for 2 weeks for medical reasons and as a result won't even see a paycheck for another 3 weeks. I just don't know what to do.

I want to move on, to stop hurting. But everything going on around me seems to make that impossible. Seeing her fall for someone else is killing me. I want to hate her, but all I can do is think of all the wonderful things we had. This is the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and she's single handedly destroying my world.

1418407482.0,9,self.relationship_advice,2p3j4r,"36M, parents won't make any effort to foster a relationship with me or my wife and kids.",willie_banger,9,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p3j4r/36m_parents_wont_make_any_effort_to_foster_a/,"I should start by explaining that I was raised in a very strict Christian home (Pentecostal). My parents made me go to church every time the doors were unlocked, and our whole lives revolved around it. In that religion, women aren't allowed to wear makeup, cut their hair, wear jewelry other than a wedding ring, and had to wear long, loose dresses or skirts. Their clothing had to completely disguise their figure, or else, in my dad's words, they were ""dressed like a whore.""

My wife and I left that church a while after getting married, and I've been attacked pretty viciously by my mother about it on a couple of occasions. My dad is just a follower, in every aspect of his life. He does what his wife tells him, what his pastor tells him, what his boss tells him, and he questions nothing. My wife wears makeup and jewelry and pants, so I'm sure he has said she looks like a prostitute, although not around me.

I still love my parents, they're not bad people. I would like to have a relationship with them, and for my kids to. The problem is, they will not move a single muscle to foster a relationship. They rarely call, never invite us over, never come to visit. If my kids have a birthday party, they will show up and stay for maybe 30 minutes, then they have to leave on some pressing business. My mother is retired and has nothing to do, yet she's always so busy she doesn't have time for anything. 

I'd like your opinion on what my duties are toward keeping a relationship with my parents. If I go for a few weeks without calling them, my dad will call me and ask me what they did to make me mad. He'll say ""it seems like you're unhappy with us about something. What can we do to make this right?"" I've told them how I feel, but nothing changes. No visits, no phone calls, no anything. I get tired of being the one to put forth all the effort. If I didn't call them or go visit them, we would just never talk, because I'm the one who does everything. 

A large part of the problem lies with their loyalty to their church. They know I had a falling out with that church and that pastor and left there, but they have never reached out to me or even been open to an explanation as to what happened, and what my wife and I have gone through with it. If we say anything they only hear that we're talking bad about their pastor, and they get very angry and defensive. So that subject is basically taboo, yet their entire life revolves around it, so that leaves a situation where they are always talking about church stuff, but we're pretty much not allowed to comment on it.

They've never abused me like you would normally think of that word--not physically, they've never called me stupid or told me I was worthless or anything--but they make me feel that way, and feel abused. The whole situation with them makes me continually unhappy, and I feel like the only option I'm left with, since I can't change them, is to change myself, and reduce my involvement with them to almost nothing. I don't want to have any regrets after they die, but I need to be fair to myself, and not pursue a relationship that essentially makes me miserable.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_2p3j4r,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p3j4r/36m_parents_wont_make_any_effort_to_foster_a/,

We met on a 1 month high school trip to Europe. I was also her first love. We were very emotionally involved for 3+ years. She's from the Northeast and I'm from the Midwest. We got to spend very little time together but I had never been so invested in someone or never cared for someone so much. She changed me and I wouldn't be who I am today without her.

I think about her mostly all day every day. We keep in contact via a few texts here and there and our relationship ended on mutual terms because of where we were at in life.  We both said, ""Hey, maybe in the future it could work out."" So there wasn't any real closure and I just find myself constantly wondering if she is thinking about me too. 

I've been in a couple other meaningful relationships since we broke up, but none of them ever worked out.  I think its mostly due to the fact that she set the bar so so so very high. My standards have been raised. It's moderately depressing, sometimes. I feel kind of apathetic about pursuing new relationships nowadays because they've been flops since her.

I think I've moved on in some ways, but definitely not in ways that foster me forgetting about her or caring about her any less.  It's pretty clear that I'm still in love with her though, and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm 22 years old and I just graduated from college in May. I met my boyfriend of a little more than 2 years in school. Things were really fun when we were a couple just living and dating on campus, when we only needed to care about going to class, doing schoolwork, etc. 


Now we're living in different states (only about 90 minutes away, but still) and I have a job 5 days a week, 9-5. We don't see each other nearly as much as we used to, not even close. We can only make time on the weekend to see each other. To add to that, he's a very strict Jew and he can't be in cars/travel from Friday night to Saturday night-- actually, I should rephrase, he can't let his very Jewish mother see him traveling in a car on Friday nights/Saturdays. He had no problem traveling on these days when we were in school. When I do visit, we're cooped up in his house until Saturday night and by the end, the weekend is essentially over. (I usually go back home early Sunday afternoon) I admit I complain a lot about this; he calls me selfish and, if he's especially mad that day, an Anti-Semite. I try to be very respectful of his religion and therefore this ""rule,"" but I can't imagine doing this for the next how many months/years when I work all week and the weekends are all I have to do anything fun or social. 


Also, he doesn't know how to drive. I've been asking him to learn how to drive for months now and he always has a new excuse, usually defaulting to ""nobody can drive me to the DMV"" or, when I ask him to take his test on the weekend, ""I can't be in a car on the weekends."" I am sick of being the only one to ever drive anywhere and I've told him this, and he just calls me selfish for it. 


We fight a lot, A LOT. I think I try to break up with him a couple of times per month. We have these explosive arguments and we both say horrible, awful things to each other. But he never stops calling, never stops texting. He manipulates my feelings, tells me I only feel like I want to break up with him for this reason or that reason, but it's never actually because of him. He tells me my feelings aren't real; I'm just overemotional and overdramatic. He says to me, ""why would you rather be alone than with someone who loves you?"" He breaks down, sobs, screams, threatens to hurt himself. He convinces me every time; I have taken him back every time. I know I can be overemotional and I can be rash, but I don't think this is right at all... I've told him sometimes relationships just don't work out and we all have to deal with breakups, but he assures me that because he still wants to be in the relationship, the relationship can't be over. He says that he gets to have a legitimate opinion of whether or not I want to break up with him, it's not just me who can decide if we should break up. 


I really feel like I should leave him, but I know we have good times &amp; I generally enjoy being with him when we're finally together... I just have a problem seeing a future with him and I'm not sure how much longer I can stand things the way they are. I have a laundry list of ""problems"" with us and I don't think that's normal. But, I'm also incredibly lonely and he really is my only friend and the only person I talk to regularly. I know if I break up with him, I'll have nobody to talk to anymore. 


tl;dr - I try to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month, he always convinces me not to/convinces me to take him back.

I could use some serious advice. I'm very unhappy.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_2p43v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p43v3/22f_my_boyfriend_wont_let_me_leave_and_im/,
