Using a throwaway because I am not sure if I can curb my bad language and I want to get everything out here. 

My husband is a wonderful person. Seriously, he puts me to shame in his patience and love. But recently I have been really frustrated by something, or someone, in our life and it is making me have a very difficult time respecting him. I feel like if you ask most men (and some women), respect is something they very much want from their spouse. This is why I feel bad. 

Okay, story time.  

My husband has a friend, let's call her Sally. Sally is married to a guy let's call him Tom. Sally has known my husband for over ten years. They are not what I would call ""close"" but they are friends.  Once a week, all three of them (along with some others) meet up to talk about God. This is not my scene right now and I don't really enjoy a majority of their company, so I don't attend and this is fine. But my husband is often saying, ""Sally really wishes you would come."" or ""Sally really wants to have you over for movies.""

[Let's stop for a moment- if Sally wants these things, why doesn't Sally contact me directly?]

Sally does not have a  lot of close friends. Sally is what I would call ""toxic"". Sally likes to gossip, say mean things and try to make people feel sorry for her. She has a common medical condition which she falls back on in terms of pity. [Sorry, I know people who have cancer that aren't total dicks.]  However, I feel sorry for her and try to hang out with her when my husband suggests. 

For some reason, Sally likes to say rude things to me. Often. Little jabs that she covers with a cunt-like laugh. I am unsure if she thinks cruelty is funny or just doesn't know what a joke is. She says things like, ""Yeah you're not very good at that,"" or ""I don't understand why you're dating him, you seem way cooler."" (when we were dating). 
This is not how I joke. I don't understand humor like this and that's okay, I don't think I would ever want to say just plain mean things about people and think it was the pinnacle of humor. 

However, because she is friends with my husband and because I don't want to ruin their friendship, and they see each other weekly, I have remained silent. I love him and do not want to cause him pain. 

However, this past week I ran into them and we talked about real estate, how my husband and I planned on upgrading. She asked where, and I said, ""Oh a townhouse in ________."" She gives that bitch laugh and goes, ""Well obviously not a house, I mean how much was (husband's) actual last raise?"" 

What. The. Fuck. 

And her spineless husband just stands there like this is an okay thing to say to someone. 

[note: We can afford a house, I just don't want a giant mortgage.]
After a week of deliberating I finally decided to say something to my husband. When I told him of all the awful things she said, (Mostly directed at him) and how much it upset me all he did was look a little surprised and nod. 

""I don't get upset by things like that."" he responded.  

Totally fair. I mean, this guy is secure and that's great.

 But when I expressed how I felt, that it made ME uncomfortable that she said these things, that I was embarrassed when she made fun of him, that it put ME in a bad situation he said nothing. He shrugged. 
""She's never said anything bad to me.""

When I pointed out that actually she had several times in my presence, he just said she was joking. When I told him of the latest thing she said, he went. ""Yeah, that's rude."" 

Yet he plans on continuing to hang out with them weekly. 

Men. Please explain this to me. Explain how someone can insult you, insult you behind your back to your wife and you still don't care. For real. For me however, friends don't talk about friends like that... I don't understand. How can you want to spend time with someone like that? 

I said I didn't want to be involved with her in any way - no more hanging out, etc. He said that was fine, but he was still going to hang out with them within the context of their once-a-week hangout. 
I am having a hard time because I think the biggest issue is I feel like I cannot respect my husband. I feel I cannot respect a man who lets people talk shit about him and just shrug his shoulders. I feel like I should -but (TO ME) there is something unappealing about a man who won't stand up for himself or his family. Maybe it's just how I was raised. I haven't told him this, but I can feel myself pulling away from him. 

Reddit, you don't know me, you don't have to like me - therefore, I would like to hear your opinions. How do I get past this? Am I a total jerk for not wanting to hang out with someone who is rude about my husband and myself?!  Am I horrible for not respecting his decision? 

I guess, if I am a jerk (and I'm open to that possibility) how can I move past this?

It's been a few years since the spilt. The relationship was disfunctional on many levels. The mom is not in a position to be able to provide for herself or the kids. Never has been, (its not a lazy issue, or health issue) although the direct result is severe debilitating depression, some subsance issues. Nothing I do or say can seem to turn it around either. The behavior the attidue displayed she clearly feels hopless. I dont have the finances to help her and live my life. 

Shes been a major factor in all my failed attempts to have any relationship with anyone else since the split, both directly, &amp; inderectly. Shes hostile to the idea of me being with anyone else. Any other female being around our children has been met with threats. Any previous attempts to discuss these issues have been met with spite words, lashing out avoiding the topic, periods of no contact, hysterical crying etc. 

Been a few years of dealing with this. I need to tell her that I want to move on in a healthy manor. I cannot allow this to continue to hold me as a person back. It has taxed me, &amp; the children so much. She cannot interfere with any of my future relationships it seriously has effected me in many more ways that I have recently came to realize. Im pretty sure the original split wasnt resolved correctly. 

So I have managed to get her to agree to a long serious talk about all of this to work something out. I need her to wake up and change some things, &amp; if she doesnt... my only other options are to walk away entirely, really let her hit rock bottom in hopes that smething comes about. Her reaction to that could be extremly volatile. 

Im sure the advice here would be counceling, but I cant afford it, &amp; I feel as though why should I continue to try and fix this person? At what poinht is enough enough, &amp; I have to go my own way.

We had a beautiful little girl together and things seemed to be going really great between us. Then she tells me that she isn't in love with me anymore. At first her reason was that there was no reason, she just fell out of love with me gradually. Then after a fee long talks we realized that it had more to do with the fact that we became so focused on surviving that we forgot about each other. 

I asked her what she thought we could do to work on things and she said nothing. That there wasn't anything to fix, nothing to fight for. But if her feelings on the matter (and me) changed, I would be the first to know. Now at first this is where I thought ""this sucks, but if I move out/on maybe she'll realize how big of a mistake she's making"". Then I found the love note from a coworker.

Apparently this guy she's worked with for a few years now has had feelings for her for awhile. And after hearing of our breakup, jumped all over it. Basically, not even a month later, she's already seeing someone else. And the pain is killing me. She swears up and down that she didn't leave me for him. "" its just really shitty timing, I'm sorry"" "" if I could go back and change it I would"". And I also get gems like ""I promise I won't shove it in your face"" and then leaves me at home with our daughter for 2 hours every day while she goes out for coffee with him. Or takes a phone call from him while we're in the middle of a serious conversation and acts like I'm not even there.

I've poured my heart out to this woman, I've begged, I've yelled, I've shown complete indifference towards her. I've tried doing everything in my power to save what we used to have. She even admits to missing it. Neither of us can remember any of the bad, only the good. But she doesn't want me. She's moved on to someone else and I'm stuck in this apartment watching her fall without a damn thing I can do about it.

I have no friends or family nearby that I can turn to. No money saved up to move. I've been out of work for 2 weeks for medical reasons and as a result won't even see a paycheck for another 3 weeks. I just don't know what to do.

I want to move on, to stop hurting. But everything going on around me seems to make that impossible. Seeing her fall for someone else is killing me. I want to hate her, but all I can do is think of all the wonderful things we had. This is the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and she's single handedly destroying my world.

My parents made me go to church every time the doors were unlocked, and our whole lives revolved around it. In that religion, women aren't allowed to wear makeup, cut their hair, wear jewelry other than a wedding ring, and had to wear long, loose dresses or skirts. Their clothing had to completely disguise their figure, or else, in my dad's words, they were ""dressed like a whore.""

My wife and I left that church a while after getting married, and I've been attacked pretty viciously by my mother about it on a couple of occasions. My dad is just a follower, in every aspect of his life. He does what his wife tells him, what his pastor tells him, what his boss tells him, and he questions nothing. My wife wears makeup and jewelry and pants, so I'm sure he has said she looks like a prostitute, although not around me.

I still love my parents, they're not bad people. I would like to have a relationship with them, and for my kids to. The problem is, they will not move a single muscle to foster a relationship. They rarely call, never invite us over, never come to visit. If my kids have a birthday party, they will show up and stay for maybe 30 minutes, then they have to leave on some pressing business. My mother is retired and has nothing to do, yet she's always so busy she doesn't have time for anything. 

I'd like your opinion on what my duties are toward keeping a relationship with my parents. If I go for a few weeks without calling them, my dad will call me and ask me what they did to make me mad. He'll say ""it seems like you're unhappy with us about something. What can we do to make this right?"" I've told them how I feel, but nothing changes. No visits, no phone calls, no anything. I get tired of being the one to put forth all the effort. If I didn't call them or go visit them, we would just never talk, because I'm the one who does everything. 

A large part of the problem lies with their loyalty to their church. They know I had a falling out with that church and that pastor and left there, but they have never reached out to me or even been open to an explanation as to what happened, and what my wife and I have gone through with it. If we say anything they only hear that we're talking bad about their pastor, and they get very angry and defensive. So that subject is basically taboo, yet their entire life revolves around it, so that leaves a situation where they are always talking about church stuff, but we're pretty much not allowed to comment on it.

They've never abused me like you would normally think of that word--not physically, they've never called me stupid or told me I was worthless or anything--but they make me feel that way, and feel abused. The whole situation with them makes me continually unhappy, and I feel like the only option I'm left with, since I can't change them, is to change myself, and reduce my involvement with them to almost nothing. I don't want to have any regrets after they die, but I need to be fair to myself, and not pursue a relationship that essentially makes me miserable.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_2p3j4r,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p3j4r/36m_parents_wont_make_any_effort_to_foster_a/,

We met on a 1 month high school trip to Europe. I was also her first love. We were very emotionally involved for 3+ years. She's from the Northeast and I'm from the Midwest. We got to spend very little time together but I had never been so invested in someone or never cared for someone so much. She changed me and I wouldn't be who I am today without her.

I think about her mostly all day every day. We keep in contact via a few texts here and there and our relationship ended on mutual terms because of where we were at in life.  We both said, ""Hey, maybe in the future it could work out."" So there wasn't any real closure and I just find myself constantly wondering if she is thinking about me too. 

I've been in a couple other meaningful relationships since we broke up, but none of them ever worked out.  I think its mostly due to the fact that she set the bar so so so very high. My standards have been raised. It's moderately depressing, sometimes. I feel kind of apathetic about pursuing new relationships nowadays because they've been flops since her.

I think I've moved on in some ways, but definitely not in ways that foster me forgetting about her or caring about her any less.  It's pretty clear that I'm still in love with her though, and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm 22 years old and I just graduated from college in May. I met my boyfriend of a little more than 2 years in school. Things were really fun when we were a couple just living and dating on campus, when we only needed to care about going to class, doing schoolwork, etc. 


Now we're living in different states (only about 90 minutes away, but still) and I have a job 5 days a week, 9-5. We don't see each other nearly as much as we used to, not even close. We can only make time on the weekend to see each other. To add to that, he's a very strict Jew and he can't be in cars/travel from Friday night to Saturday night-- actually, I should rephrase, he can't let his very Jewish mother see him traveling in a car on Friday nights/Saturdays. He had no problem traveling on these days when we were in school. When I do visit, we're cooped up in his house until Saturday night and by the end, the weekend is essentially over. (I usually go back home early Sunday afternoon) I admit I complain a lot about this; he calls me selfish and, if he's especially mad that day, an Anti-Semite. I try to be very respectful of his religion and therefore this ""rule,"" but I can't imagine doing this for the next how many months/years when I work all week and the weekends are all I have to do anything fun or social. 


Also, he doesn't know how to drive. I've been asking him to learn how to drive for months now and he always has a new excuse, usually defaulting to ""nobody can drive me to the DMV"" or, when I ask him to take his test on the weekend, ""I can't be in a car on the weekends."" I am sick of being the only one to ever drive anywhere and I've told him this, and he just calls me selfish for it. 


We fight a lot, A LOT. I think I try to break up with him a couple of times per month. We have these explosive arguments and we both say horrible, awful things to each other. But he never stops calling, never stops texting. He manipulates my feelings, tells me I only feel like I want to break up with him for this reason or that reason, but it's never actually because of him. He tells me my feelings aren't real; I'm just overemotional and overdramatic. He says to me, ""why would you rather be alone than with someone who loves you?"" He breaks down, sobs, screams, threatens to hurt himself. He convinces me every time; I have taken him back every time. I know I can be overemotional and I can be rash, but I don't think this is right at all... I've told him sometimes relationships just don't work out and we all have to deal with breakups, but he assures me that because he still wants to be in the relationship, the relationship can't be over. He says that he gets to have a legitimate opinion of whether or not I want to break up with him, it's not just me who can decide if we should break up. 


I really feel like I should leave him, but I know we have good times &amp; I generally enjoy being with him when we're finally together... I just have a problem seeing a future with him and I'm not sure how much longer I can stand things the way they are. I have a laundry list of ""problems"" with us and I don't think that's normal. But, I'm also incredibly lonely and he really is my only friend and the only person I talk to regularly. I know if I break up with him, I'll have nobody to talk to anymore.

Aside from the domestic front they put on, their relationship is kind of a mess but he is the first person that. I know that my opinion on their relationship is irrelevant, however. 

I have not talked to her about it yet because she tends to be abrasive and selfish and I'm worried that talking to her about it will just make a situation where she is pissed off and awkward. 

Her boyfriend lives about 45 minutes to an hour away (depending on traffic) but works about 15 minutes from our house. I think this is the main reason that he is always over, for convenience. He has also started showering at our place, and she has started doing his laundry at our place. 

Any advice on how to approach this situation with someone who is a friend before she was a roommate, but tends to be defensive and rude and passive aggressive? Yikes. I think she will take this really personally as it is the ""first man she's ever loved"" and she ""plans"" on marrying him someday.

She refers to me as her best friend but we have only hung out once. I recently told her that I like her and would like to spend some more time together. Her reply was ""you da best"" so I know I am just a friend. Recently, she is talking to another guy at work. She claims that he is just a friend but I think she is saying that so she won't hurt my feelings. I think she likes him because they have been spending a lot of time out of work together. Anytime he starts to text her or call her I get ignored. For example I asked her a question last night and she never replied back. She picks and chooses when she wants to talk to me. I tried to gradually stop talking to her and she picked up on it and asked me why I am ignoring her. It's not that she doesn't like me back that bothers me so much but it's more of she never wants to hang out. I am a texting buddy and I hate that. She has made plans to hang out with me in the past and something always comes up at the last second. For example two weeks ago we were supposed to hang out before I left town to spend thanksgiving with my family. The night before she told me we can't hang out because she has food poisoning. The next day babysat her friends kid and then went out to eat with a group of friends. That is just one of the many incidents where she asked me to hang out and later cancels on me.

I acknowledge that I am a rather emotional individual, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I am, gladly, pretty good at identifying with my friends, family, etc on a social, emotional level. Under regular stress, I can manage my emotional state no problem. I'm a level-headed fellow, I do martial arts, I'm mentally and physically disciplined, I am educated, I work full-time like a good little puppet of the system, all that good stuff. But as of lately, this emotional quality of mine seems to have spiked. Here's why:

My family is dealing with personal stuff that I cannot divulge into, but the end result of this is that I am nauseatingly stressed out by it. It is not something I can just share with anyone either, so it's eating at me inside (every family has their fair share of personal problems to deal with). The few people I have discussed this personal issue with cannot do anything about it because of the nature of the issue. Don't worry, the other stress factors are more concrete and tangible.

I am applying to medical school right now. I just had my interview with my top school choice and I find out the results (hopefully) within this upcoming week. There's so much riding on this God-willing acceptance and it's very difficult to deal with. Such scared. Very stress. Much anxiety. Wow.

The girl I'm dating is away for medical school right now and the distance is pretty hard to deal with. Long distance is always hard. Before, we would actively talk and text and Skype back and forth. Now, she's not able to do so as much. She's a good, religious, thoughtful girl so I trust that she isn't ignoring me or toying with me. NORMALLY, this stuff would not bother me for the obvious reason - she's in medical school, she's busy as fuck. I need to calm down and take a step back and relax.

Buuuuuuuut... all these stressors are affecting my mood and as a naturally emotional individual, it's kind of getting harder to deal with. I find myself being more bothered with the distance. I've conveyed this to her and she reassures me that she is very interested in our relationship and I'm not doing anything wrong. She is glad I conveyed my worries to her like someone in a normal, healthy relationship would do. But I'm afraid to keep bugging her about it because I don't want to come off as needy or some crap like that. I really just need someone to shake me awake and reassure me that I need to relax.

I did something very stupid when I was 19 and living in a big city for the summer and I am terrified that it's going to haunt me. It kind of haunts me every now and then when I reflect back on it, and I cringe at the thought. I even told an ex about it once, who thought it was pretty fucked up but wasn't freaked out by it, and a couple of close friends when it happened. My paranoia is that the internet is forever and should I be worried.

Basically, in my darkest of phases, I stupidly posted an ad on craigslist - with photos of my FACE - basically trying to solicit sex with a hot stranger. On top of that, I corresponded with lots of men via e-mail - using my REAL NAME (albeit an old e-mail address). Even worse, I received over 200+ responses, and those are just the responses... Meaning, tons of people saw this shit, including a boy from college who I'd never met, and who lived several hours away and responded to my ad with ""OMG weren't you in my ____ lecture at ____ University???"" I was of course mortified and never responded to him, still have no idea who he is (it was one of those 400 person lectures), but hopefully he has moved on.

Despite this huge massive unforgivable fuck up and not understanding that The Internet Is Forever (in my defense, this was 2007 and I was dumb as shit), I have a normal life and am doing really well career-wise and have never done anything like that again. But sometimes I've entertained the thought of doing a name change JUST because I'm worried this will somehow come back to haunt me one day.

I tried to login to my old craigslist account using that old e-mail address, and I had no active posts and there was nothing on there. I must have deleted it at the time, but given that shit is so difficult to get rid of on Facebook, I thought that maybe I'd have to go through multiple steps in order to ensure that it's gone forever. However, I can't find it. What the fuck do I do? 

Thank you in advance.

I'll admit first and foremost that I understand that this is a conversation that I need to have with my girlfriend.  It will happen.  I will talk to her.  But, I'd like some community advice.

We have a good relationship.  We laugh, we love each other, and I know she's a wonderful person.  

I love my girlfriend very much.  To think that I don't love her enough to marry her makes me feel guilty.  I haven't been comfortable with the idea of getting married and I can't pinpoint if it's just me, or if it's the idea of getting married to my girlfriend.

Almost every thread that I've come across has had multiple people stating that it's probably because I don't love her enough, and I'm not committed enough.  That I'm not a good person, I don't deserve her, or anyone.  I don't want that to be true.  I don't want to be an uncommitted, irresponsible, childish piece of trash.

It's really hard for me to articulate what I'm thinking.

She's starting to push really hard, and the thought of marriage, the future, and children and so on makes her feel comfortable.  She loves me, and she wants to marry me.  But I'm not sure if it's because she wants to marry *me*, or if she's just so obsessed with the thought of being married that she wants to so bad.  It's very important to her, and she's beginning to bring it up on a weekly, if not every-other-day, basis.  Thinking about the future just makes me nervous, though.

I'm an unsuccessful software engineer.  I make jack shit for money.  I have terrible credit.  I don't own *anything*.  I don't have a degree.  I'm overweight.  I'm pretty much the last person anyone should want to marry.  I don't feel comfortable with myself, and I think it makes me hard to understand or be comfortable with someone else wanting to marry me.

I know I need to grow up.  I have no idea what I'm even writing right now.  I'm just not sure if I'm ready for marriage, even after ~5 years.  Does that mean I'm a bad person?  Does that mean I don't love her like I think I do?

I just thought that I needed time to figure how I felt out and decide, but I don't want to string her along.  It would be terrible for us both, and I know we'd both be depressed, but would it be better for us to break up, so she can find someone deserving of her?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1418422177.0,,,True,t3_2p49po,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p49po/i_m27_dont_know_if_i_want_to_get_married_to_f25/,

We fit great together and are lovers but also friends. It's the first time in my life that I have someone who really understands everything I say and views things the same as I do. I have mild asperger's (diagnosed) and we're both fairly sure she has too (undiagnosed). It's refreshing and awesome to have someone who understands you and who likes the same things. (and that goes a lot further than liking the same books and movies)


There's one problem however. I've noticed that many people with asperger's hate social obligations and while they are often good at talking with strangers (if they learned themselves how to small-talk) they can't really make friends. For some reason they feel more obliged to help a stranger than to help someone who's close to them and who does a lot for them.


Both my dad, my gf and myself have this. Because I saw how annoying it was in my dad I've learned to control it in myself and I don't really do it anymore. My gf however didn't have a parent like that and is still this way. 


This is really, really annoying since it's frustrating to have a gf who has no time to help you because of school (sort of justified in engineering, but she's taking it to the extreme) but who helps someone else in an instant. She's a perfectionist and is very, very busy with school but I feel that she could make time to meet me once a week or every two weeks, but she doesn't seem to want to because it feels like an obligation to meet.


I've tried to make her look in herself and try to adjust for it like I did with myself, but she obviously doesn't like that I'm 'trying to change who she is'. She also said some worrying things like that ' it's ok to live without looking inside, once in a while you have a bad period but it goes over '. I don't feel like this is healthy at all.


Is it possible to help her and change this? I think that she has to change this herself but I don't really know how I can help her with it. All I can do is show her where she goes wrong but I hurt her a lot with that, since I'm revealing a side of her that she's trying to hide from herself.


You might say that it's an unhealthy relation, but I'm afraid I won't really find someone like me who doesn't do this. She's very rational and no-nonsense about other things so I thought that this could be fixed, but now I'm not so sure anymore.

I've also made another post in the other relationship subreddit, but at that time I didn't really figure out what the core of the problem was. It might help to give you more background though:

I dont know how i feel about this, i love her and i want to marry her but is it too soon or am i too scared? any advice would really help.

But I want him back",yuyu11,1,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p482g/ex_bf_25m_of_5_years_wants_to_be_friends_with_me/,"Hi all, Any advice or comments on this would be much appreciated! Here's the background:

Met my bf in college sophomore year. We got along great, and had the same group of friends. He got a job right out of college, and I moved to that same city to be with him.  Even though he didn't want me living with him yet (after 3 yrs) I got a job and lived on my own. We were still madly in love. I cooked for him, baked, bought him things out of the blue, planned cool dates for us (like zip lining an Avicii concert, etc.), I took care of him when he was sick, I went to every family event with him (which was a lot).....I thought I was a good girlfriend. I did all these things because I loved him. We had fun together, we had the same interests, we would watch football together, mma fighting, play video games together, go to comic book shops together and just be silly together. 

The problem is that he recently accepted a job in Germany for 2 years. he said initially he wanted us to be to together but then changed his mind a few weeks later... saying he needed to focus on himself. At this point we had been together 5 years. He wants to be friends and even added me on Skype so we could talk... this is INCREDIBLY hard for me. I am still in love with him. We broke up the end up sept. and he left for Germany the end of November. I don't know what to do at this point. I want him back but I don't know if ""being friends"" will help. I don't know if I still have a chance. Should I cut ties permanently  or continue to talk to him? Am I hurting my chances of getting him back if we are friends?

I should add that he was very difficult to get along with a lot of the time.  We didn't really have fights but we did have disagreements and instead of trying to work things out like I wanted, he would ignore me.  He was paranoid about things and blamed a lot of this problems on me. despite everything I still loved him.  I think he thought that a relationship should have no fights what so ever...which is insane. I also got jealous some times (what girl doesn't?) Anyway I always worked hard to improve myself and be better for us. I told him I was trying to be a better person... I didn't think I was a bad gf. I never cheated, I was patient with him and would do anything for him. Do I have a chance of him wanting me back?

1418406598.0,0,self.relationship_advice,2p3hdy,"Does sincerely admitting fault count as an apology? Or are the worlds ""I'm sorry"" a requirement?",Joe2478,0,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p3hdy/does_sincerely_admitting_fault_count_as_an/,"I've always thought saying ""I'm sorry"" as an apology to be too simplistic/cookie-cutter or a phrase and one best used for when you bump into a stranger at a grocery store. Much like saying, ""How are you doing today?"" being a routine greeting. Most of the time you're not actually asking the person to tell you how they're day is going, it's just a more polite or friendly greeting.

I was playing a video game the other day and I snapped at my girlfriend when she asked me something (neither of us remember what the topic even was). In my mind, I **immediately** knew I'd done something wrong. She said something along the lines of, ""Do you think that was appropriate?"", to which I replied, ""No, you're right. I was wrong and I shouldn't have said that."" (I know I **should** have apologized immediately, before she said something, but it's too late for that.)

**Is that an apology?**

A major part of this from my gf's POV is the lack of sincerity. Because I didn't stop the game, turn around, and apologize while looking in her eyes, it wasn't sincere. I told her that had I looked at her and tossed out an ""I'm sorry"", it wouldn't have felt genuine, and that was I did say was **much** more sincere and heartfelt. I've always felt content means more than presentation, with this situation being a perfect example.

Assuming we're not the only couple with this issue, I wanted to reach out and get other viewpoints on it, and where better than /r/relationship_advice?

We met online, and when I moved to go to law school in Boston, he found a job in the area and moved there with me (separate apartments).  He is smart, kind, funny, and really caring towards me and his family.  He is the kind of man that I envision as the father to my children someday.  We have been discussing marriage pretty seriously.

My issue is that he omits lots of information in our relationship about pretty important stuff.  Like, one omission could be seen as a white lie, but this happens once or twice every month about pretty serious shit!  For example, he told me that he had his Master's Degree, but really one of the courses was not accepted towards his degree and he never completed it.  I found this out because his mother told me on a visit to his family's house, and my ignorance of an important situation in his life was really embarrassing for me.  He took a course over the summer to make up the credits that were not accepted, but what was he planning on doing, telling me that this course was to ""shore up his resume"" and pretend that he had his degree all along?  Additionally, he was going through a disciplinary action at work for over a month (which eventually led to him being fired) and he never told me about it.  I found out about this only after he was actually fired!  Even more questionable is that my background is in HR, so I could have offered some pretty good advice if he wanted to keep his job.  Another example is when he started seeing a therapist after he was fired (which was a really good call, I'll give him that!), and he hid it for 2-3 sessions by saying that he had a doctor's appoint or car appointment.  This list could go on and on, but suffice it to say that he keeps hiding important, sensitive stuff from me and I am beginning to question our relationship.

The straw that broke the camel's back (and caused me to write this post) was that he is still lying about completing his graduate coursework.  When plugging his phone into a charger, I saw an email that his grade for a summer course was STILL incomplete and he would not be graduating unless it was changed immediately.  I talked to him about it today on Gchat because the graduation deadline is approaching, and he flat-out lied and told me he got an A in the course!  I know that most of this stuff is embarrassing for a man, especially a high achiever who went to a top-ranked undergrad and was told he was a ""special snowflake"" because he was so smart all through his formative years.  But this is getting out of hand!  

I have talked to him multiple times about this fibbing/lying/omitting/whatever (last time was about 3 months ago), and he says each time that he will be more honest and open with me.  Yet, he continues to leave out serious stuff that is happening in his life, and actions are starting to speak louder than words.

I brought up breaking up 3 nights ago to him because I had been feeling down about the relationship and felt hurt that he did not want to work on it with me. We had been arguing quite a bit. After telling him that I did not think I could do it anymore, he told me to give it a couple hours because I was acting emotional. A couple hours later he called and we talked, the conversation went well. We met face to face and he decided that he ""needed to find himself."" He explained that he was not making much effort because he did not know how to balance me with other things that he wanted to do. He emphasized how much he loved me and how happy he was that he got to date me. He recently got laid off from a job that he was really excited about, so I believe this also may play a part. But, we have broken up before for the same reason and gotten back together. So, I think I am holding on to some hope that it may happen again. I regret my decision to bring it up. We talked on the phone for an hour today and he said that he is hurt too and it's hard for him right now. But, we both know this is right for us to grow individually. He feels that he spent a lot of time in my life and wasn't able to bring me into his. I asked him if he could see us together in the future, and he said yes he can but not for awhile.

We then took a break from each other but his car got stolen, and he called to tell me and i offered to bring him to work and school (i have to pass him house to get to campus and work. plus we work at restaurants on the same street so it makes sense) So we had sex again (i can't remember the circumstances but i was at his house and it happened). We were trying to just be friends though, so having sex made everything extremely complicated. He was kind of treating me like a shitty friend, and i going crazy and being clingy, so we stopped having sex. I could feel him pulling away so naturally, instead of giving him the space his needed i just got more crazy. Last sunday, he broke things off again and asked for a clean break.

Well its the christmas season and the restaurant i work at has been playing freaking romantic christmas music and i was on my period and super sad and lonely so when i got off work i swung by his house to see if he was home. I asked him to not move on from me, to keep loving me, because it took losing him to realize how much love him, how happy he makes me, and how complete my life is with him in it. all he said was that he couldn't make any promises, but how it is now (use not speaking at all) isn't going to be how it is forever. 

i ended up staying at his house for a few hours and we just talked caught up, talked about finals and such. It was just like how it was when we first started dating. We were happy for so long. everyone thought we were going to be together forever (except my family but htats another story) it wasn't until like the 9 month mark that shit just started hitting the fan.

Everyone just keeps telling me that i just need to forget about him and i just need a good lay to get him off my mind. first cut is the deepest and all that jazz.

what do y'all think?

** TL;DR basically i broke up with my boyfriend, tried to get back together, we then had a sexual relationship, then stopped talking, then started having sex again, then stopped and now were on a clean break (no talking at all) but I asked him to wait for me because i love him and want to be with him and all he said was he can't promise me that or anything. So should i move on or just wait it out?**
