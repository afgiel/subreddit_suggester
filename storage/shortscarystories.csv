I was walking back from the comfort room cause I needed to pee.  
And that's the first time I saw Santa.  
I saw him went inside my grandpa's room.  
He must be leaving his gift for him.  
I mischievously waited for him in my room.  
And the next thing I remember?  
I woke up on Christmas day with a gift in my room like everybody else in our house.  
But the sad thing is, grandpa never woke up.  
That's when I started hating Christmas.  
.  
Today, I cleared all my doubts.  
I just realized how impossible Santa could exist.  
And two years ago, that guy can't be Santa.  
Cause Santa should be wearing red not black,  
And should be carrying a sack, not a scythe.  
At least today I can stop bragging my friends  
That I see Santa everyday.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_2p26g2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2p26g2/christmas_contest_i_see_santa_everyday/,

Well shit, this year I have a lot of wishes.

I wish I didn't drink so much.  I wish I didn't piss my wife off so much.  I wish I was there more for my kids.  I wish I didn't have to sell my old comic books to pay for this santa suit.  I wish I knew my wife had taken the kids to her mother's.  I wish they were home.  I wish I was 30 pounds lighter.  Most of all, I wish someone could hear me in screaming in this chimney.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_2p4bee,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/2p4bee/christmas_contestchristmas_wishes/,
