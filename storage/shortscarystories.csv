Seen all of the belts, pills, elliptical/treadmill hybrids the mind could possibly invent. Eating my feelings, not exercising...it's a quick slide to the bottom of the physical fitness scale. But of course, like I said, I knew better than to trust those commercials. 

The lotion was a gift.

My husband had bought it for me. A nice surprise, really, since I felt our marriage had been slowing down the past few years. His unwillingness to maintain physical contact, his averted gaze whenever we spoke... Richard had always been a nice guy but suddenly he'd changed, becoming a person I didn't know. He wasn't attracted to me, wanted a divorce. I wanted to work it out.

But the lotion was a peace offering. 

""It's a gift, from a medicine woman,"" he said, giving me a small smile. ""She uses it to help those who want to lose weight but conventional methods seem to not work."" I kissed him gently, thanking him for the gift. I was happy he was making an effort again.

That night, after I got out of the tub, I rubbed the lotion on my body, legs first. Richard had told me that I needed to make sure to rub it in...the heat of the rubbing activates it.

I waited.

Waited.

Burning sensations started. My body was overwhelmingly hot, boiling under the lotion. The skin started to peel and I began to panic. As I stood up to make my way back to the shower to rinse it off, skin began decomposing and sliding off my bones.  I screamed.

 And Richard laughed.

I turned back to my monitor, London was experiencing a brown out in the third quarter and a red bar flashed consistently across my screen. With a swiping motion I cleared the alert, activating backup generators to pull in the extra energy needed.

Me and Michael were lost until we found this old abandoned house and slept for only two hours until two mysterious man appeared and started this mess.

I kept closing my eyes until someone grabbed me.

""Come here you bitch."" Someone said in a somewhat low voice.

I quickly hit his chest and begging to let me go, but he refused.
He began to forcefully throw me onto Michael's corpse.

How disgusting it smelt.

Come to think of it, I knew this was my last stop. My last breath.
My last moment.

The last thing I will see is a painting of a creature hanged on the wall with a background that is night time, the painting of a creature's frightening face, yellow glowing eyes adjusting on me.

I began to calm down and looked at the masked man now ready to hack me into pieces.

""I'm ready."" I whispered.

""What?"" The man said as the other tilted his head.

""I'm read-""

I now lost consciousness.

I was.

""Come visit with me,"" he would say cheerfully to anyone who walked past.

And of course, a lot of people would NOT enter his box. Most would even ignore him, and walk a little faster as they passed by.

But every once in a while, there was someone who would take pity on him and crawl into his box. They would chat with the nice homeless man for a couple minutes and disappear, never to be seen again. Their stories went up as kidnappings on the nightly news. Names were mentioned and fingers were pointed, but no one knew the actual truth. 

Then one day, someone passing by the nice homeless man's box noticed the man wasn't there. Becoming curious, she peered inside the man's tiny box, seeing a horrific sight. Getting a closer look, she noticed there a hole where the man usually sat, filled with dead bodies. Taped to one of the dismembered hands was a note that said ""Merry Christmas! Ho Ho Ho!""

It had taken them most of Christmas eve day to decorate it.
The lights had been the problem.  After struggling to untangle the knotted and twisted strands and managing to find a way to plug in all the strands with out blowing a fuse AGAIN.  They now stood in front of the Christmas tree.

What a tree! Strands of multicolored lights blinked merrily from their pine needle nests. Ornaments of every type filled the branches and the crowning glory, a multicolored stained glass star sat atop the tree.

As they stood, dressed in their Sunday best Mr. Clark spoke up.

""Ok, get your coats.  We need to get to Grandma and Grandpas before the food gets cold!""

Suddenly the chime of the door bell rang out.

"" Who can that be?"" said Mrs. Clark.
"" It's  Santa!"" said little Noel
"" It's the Grinch with your present."" said Gabe messing her hair.

Mr. Clark left the room to answer the bell. 

Then the shots rang out.
