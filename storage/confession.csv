[No Regrets]: I kicked out my Ex SO in August and won the  ""Extra"" in a weekly lottery two months later.  Thank goodness we didn't live together long enough for him to benefit as he has no entitlement under law. As I had filed a police report against him, I was able to use this report to prevent the lottery corporation from
publishing my information for safety reasons. I'm keeping this info in the family.

1418390485.0,98,self.confession,2p2rc6,I have a bizarre fetish,thr0wawaypervert,98,0,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2p2rc6/i_have_a_bizarre_fetish/,"At least fetish is what my research has indicated it most likely is, though I haven't managed to find a single other person who shares it.  Fetishes are apparently much more common in males than females too, and I'm female.

I lost my virginity at 13 but didn't have my first orgasm until 19, and then it was through solitary masturbation, not sex, and the first time I had attempted masturbating, had no idea how to even start before that.  At the time I was dating an alcoholic, and I fantasized about him drinking a lot while masturbating.  Of course I enjoyed the orgasm but felt weird having thought about something not even related to sex to achieve it.  I tried looking at porn and thinking about all kinds of sex-related stuff but never could come close to an orgasm again for quite awhile, until I again started thinking about an alcoholic drinking.

For the next several years I only masturbated rarely, because I still didn't really know how to do it very well and the things I had to think about to have an orgasm disturbed me.  Eventually I got over the embarrassment and confusion enough to masturbate regularly and started being able to have mind-blowing orgasms, and series of them to the point I'd be exhausted afterward.  I still only ever did it alone though, because if someone were having sex with me it distracted me too much from what I needed to focus on.  I've had sex with, well, way too many people (had wild partying years in my teens and 20s, have calmed way down with only several additional sex partners since then, in my early 40s now) and on a very few occasions have been able to masturbate and orgasm during sex, while thinking about something completely different than what was actually going on.  I haven't told any of my sex partners what it takes for me to have an orgasm, only that it's difficult, all in my head and if I don't have one it's absolutely not their fault.  I have told a few people online, only after they begged to know and promised they wouldn't think it was weird, but then without exception they did either think it was weird and/or didn't understand it at all.

So I'll try to explain here.  It's not just alcoholics/drinking, though that remains one of my favorite fantasies to use for orgasms.  It seems to be an ""addiction"" fetish.  I can think about a wide variety of substances and behaviors which are harmful in excess and can be addictive.  It's not a turn on to me if the person I'm fantasizing about can control their behavior, only if they can't, and especially if they repeatedly try and fail to stop or cut down, and if it seriously disrupts their lives and health, though I've never fantasized about anyone dying of addiction/overdose.  I have tried many drugs, been addicted to a few but was able to break the habits.  Now I only drink rarely, use prescription pills to relax and get high occasionally and marijuana regularly, for which I have a medical card.  Interestingly, I have never been able to have an orgasm thinking about marijuana ""abuse"" I think because I don't think of it as a potentially harmful drug, or at least not harmful enough.  I can think about myself or other people using drugs I've never even tried though, like heroin, and have orgasms that way.  Though I'm heterosexual, my orgasm fantasies can involve just me, me and another person or just another person/other people who can be male or female, though I have no desire for any sexual relation with another female.  I'd like to stay single forever actually, especially since I'm only really attracted to people who are addicted to something and messing their lives up over it which doesn't make for a good relationship outside of sex.

The closest things I've found online to what turns me on are feeder/feedee/weight gain/food addiction scenarios, and some people, again almost all male, are turned on by drunk people though with them it seems to be related to being able to more easily take advantage of them or have sex with someone who's passed out which I'm not into.  I don't think about sex at all to have orgasms, only substance abuse and addiction.  I used to frequent feeder/feedee sites but was ostracized since I'm not overweight or wanting to gain, just the idea of it turns me on.  Also those people, the women mostly, were bothered that I'm turned on by the loss of control and detrimental aspects of weight gain, while they like to pretend it's all positive, beautiful and practically risk-free.

So yeah, I'm a sicko and stuff.  I'd love to be able to find other people online who more fully share my type of fantasies but so far no luck, keeping me pretty confident that I am the only person or one of very few with this particular fetish.

Throwaway as my identity could be known by others on Reddit. Some details have been changed slightly too.

I, male mid 30's, am in a long term relationship of 5+ years with my girlfriend, also mid 30's. We are in the process of buying a house and planning our future. There's no doubt that she's ""the one"" in my my mind which makes my desire to cheat on her even more disturbing to me. 

I suppose to say I have an affair wouldn't be strictly true. I want to have a fling, a one night stand etc. 

Prior to meeting her, I have had 10+ girlfriends and several relationships I would define as long term so have a good amount of experience with women of all shapes, sizes and colors. 

Over the past few months, I feel that the closer to ""settling down"" I get, the more my urge to have a fling rises. I know there's probably some psychological reason behind this but one thing I worry about is that I have the opportunity on occasion look for and be with another woman but have yet to see it through to fruition.

We'll Call her J. I knew her a few years ago at a local dance studio. I was a student for ballroom and J taught a hip hop class. I was crushing on J a little bit but I was only 14 or so.

Fast forward to now and we both moved into our current place within the same week. J has a boyfriend, T,  but he is a major douche. T has cheated on her at least 3 times that she has caught him.

About a week ago T and our other housemate were at work and we were sitting on the couch talking for a few hours. It started out fairly innocent, what we've been up to since I last saw her, what kind of work we are looking for. Then we get onto the topic of T. J told me about how T has cheated on her several times, even once in her own bed that she walked in on. I told her that T is a major idiot for cheating on her, and then I just decided to make a move. We made out on the couch until they got home, and we quickly went back to our seats and acted like nothing happened.

The next night J picked me up from work, we went home and spent the night in her bed, again until they were nearly home. Since then we haven't spent a night without sharing a bed, but we don't always have sex, Just sleep. I've fallen for her and she tells me that she feels the same, but is still in a relationship with T.

I honestly don't know what to do right now because I have fallen pretty hard for J, but T is still in the picture. I don't want to try and break them up because that could cause all kinds of issues given T works with our other housemate, and J could end up getting hurt emotionally if they split.

After reading the submission rules, I noticed that excessively sexual content is not allowed.  That's fine, but I'm of the opinion that a big chunk of this started with sexuality.  With this in mind, I'm going to make an honest effort to keep the sexuality to a minimum.  With that out of the way, I'd like to tell you a few things about me.

I'm 28.  Male.  Um, what else would you like to know?  Much like yourself, I am a redditor, but this is a throwaway account just because.  This doesn't need to be public knowledge, in my opinion.  With THAT out of the way...

Since I was about 14 or maybe 15, I've been fascinated with spanking.  When I was a teenager, it was mostly sexual, but as I've matured, it's not entirely sexual anymore.  I've been involved with a person for approximately 11 months that I suppose understands me, I guess.  It's not a sexual thing, but usually, they're just a text message or a phone call away.

It feels so awkward to talk about this.  If that part of my personality isn't given it wants, I feel weird.  Almost like a top that just keeps spinning.

In my unhidden life, I work a job that causes me stress and other unwanted things.  I'd rather not tell you what I do, if that's okay.  A few days after everything that I've had to do calms down, I'll get in touch with my partner and we discuss a time that works for us.  I'll visit their home and after it takes place, I feel a wonderful sense of relief.  I'm not even sure if it's relief.  In any event, it's a good feeling and I'm grateful to be able to experience it after a stressful time in my life.

Maybe that doesn't seem so weird to you, but I'm betting this will.  Sometimes, my partner is unable to connect with me.  During these rather disappointing times, I'm likely to just spank myself.  It doesn't bring me the same relief that having my partner do it to me does, but if I don't, I feel out of sorts.

I tried fetlife, but I wasn't able to make any lasting connections with people and at times, it became a little too sexual.  I realize that once clothes are disrobed, those feelings are likely to occur, but when it comes to spanking, sexuality has it's time, but it's not 100% of the time.

When these feelings and this whole thing first started, I felt really weird.  Almost like an oddity, but as time wore on, it occurred to me that the feelings that come from this aren't bad feelings.  Logically, this isn't that weird at all.  I'm not a freak or an oddity.  I'm just a little different.

I sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this.  I hope you a have a pleasant evening.  Take care.

The kicker is that I am technically Jewish because my mother is Jewish. I had a somewhat Jewish upbringing. For example, I went to Jewish Sunday school and Jewish summer camp. However, it was not a part of my daily life. Despite that, I had always identified with being Jewish as a kid. 

Problems started when I was 13 and did not have a Bar Mitzvah but other Jewish kids did. My mom probably couldn't have afforded it anyways. I felt that's when Jewish kids started to treated me like an outsider. I guess they thought I wasn't 'Jewish' enough and therefore was a poser or something. It hurt bad because I had really wanted to explore my Jewish roots and had always identified as being Jewish. 

Another issue that came up was that they were rich and I was not. Their parents bought them cars, paid for their college tuition, bills, cell phones, insurance, etc. My mother did not and not because she wanted to teach us about responsibility but because she didn't care. I felt that sort of 'validated' that I was not 'good enough' to be Jewish.

Finally, I think most Jewish women are bitches. I think they are demanding, opinionated, bitchy, don't give a shit about anyone else, complain about every thing, and believe they are better than most people and expect people to treat them as princesses. I guess that's why so many of them are single LOL.

**Confession time**: I see my Psychologist for anxiety related issues. Sometimes even a blocked number will send me into a tizzy. Thankfully for the most part I've overcome that. I see him now to stop catastrophic thinking. I always thought this guy was cute, intelligent and I very much like the way he is blunt with his advice. Problem is, 4 months into this I want to fuck him. I am not in love with him, I have no childhood boohoo story, no daddy issues, nothing that normal transference accounts for. I just straight up want to fuck him on his desk because his intelligence and degrees turn me on. Now I have been taking to wearing sexier clothing (within the realm of reason) to my sessions. The taboo even turns me on a bit. I am so frustrated I actually posted on CL trying to find someone to fulfill my fantasy so I can continue seeing my psych and not try to fuck him in session.

Throwaway because my gf know my main account

So I'm 17 right (3 months to 18) and I will start from here:

* Since even before I was born to now my father has been an alchoholic. From there the usual - violence and poverty. He has never beat me up though(except one time where he hit me once when I was 6-7 but it was quite hard), only my mother. I've seen her get hit, thrown things at her, even once he broke her glasses and the glass penetrated her skin. 
Every. Single. Day. There is yelling in our apartment. The only time when there's no yelling is when he's in his village house for a few days (happens once every 2-3 months). My brother who is 9 years older than me has never given a fuck and is almost always outside with his friends and sometimes doesnt come home (hes 27 now working and still lives here without paying a single bill). My father is the only working one because my mom is not in the right health conditions to work and they're not divorcing because he has nowhere to go and she hasn't got anywhere to get money from.

* So that has left me with some experience in dealing with drunk people and for years i've never been taken care of properly so I was basicly a kid who lived in the streets during the day. I was left by myself to grow my personality (which turned out to be nice if I consider the words from most of my friends). I learnt everything either myself or by friends (or strangers). I also grew common sense.

* People say I'm a nice guy and I guess I am. There've been a few times in school where some idiot breaks something and I take the blame just cause, eventhough I hate the moron who did it. I help people and give to people. This has led  to me being nice to everyone and conform with everyone despite me disagreeing with what they want. That will be important later on.
So with these ""properties"" of mine a lot of people like talking to me as I am a good listener and like sharing their secrets or burdens.

* Also I am very insecure. I never told my first true crush that I liked her for years and how beautiful she is because she never liked me (she shared with me who she likes) (I still like her and want her to be a part of me eventhough I have a girlfriend but about this later). I had never shared any problem of mine or anything to anyone untill later on (you'll see) because I don't want people to be weighed by my problems. I've always just compressed my anger, feelings and problems and just ignore it. Sometimes I want to kill someone or beat up some one but I stop myself. I've wanted to throw myself from the balcony or from a high building but there's always someone around me and I dont want them to freak out or anything. Also I convince myself that it will get better.

* So I'm also a gamer. Been playing games since I was 4. I love games. They're everything to me. I would waste every penny I could find on an internet cafe and play games. up untill late late 2009 when my brother got a PC. Games have been probably 80% of the sponge that takes up my anger, regrets and bad feelings. And I'm good at them. Give me a game and I will learn to play it very good for no time at all. I've played hundrets of games through the years and I just love it!

* This leads to what I think is my biggest regret - lazyness.
I want to be a game developer to make games. I have some crazy ideas that have never been done and if I make them I'm sure a lot of poeple will like them. BUT I never do shit. I start learning some programming language and stop after a few sessions.. then I tell bullshit to everyone how good I am at computer stuff but in reality im not doing anything. Just playing more games. I always tell myself I need to get out of the shit and do something to make my life get better, but I never do anything. If I do it's for 2 days maximum. That's what I forgot. I'ma good liar. I've been lying about shit (all kinds of shit) since I can remember myself. 80% of the lies I have told are still going on and when some one reminds me of some lie that I have told I'm like ""yea yea that's true"".

* Soo I've never had a normal conversation with a girl. I've always been anxious around them and suddenly this girl starts texting me. So we chat through facebook and chat and chat and looks like she has been dreaming of me having sex with her. Sooo we went out once and it got to her telling me about her personal problems (because she has had some shit happen to her but not so bad, but she thinks is the worst because she's very self centered, thinks she cant be wrong and incredibly emotional). And because I dont want to make her feel left out I told her about SOME of my problems. I didn't want to. But I did. Anyway she gets into me and I kind of start getting into her but I dont want it because she's just... she doesnt have common sense. Any at all. But I still do it because I feel sorry. I still like this other girl. So because I conform with everyone I start to be careful with my gf's feelings and limit myself with contacts with other girls. Yeah I stopped chatting with the girl I like (I dont care if I dont have a chance, she's a great person and a great friend). I hate myself for that. I started treating her coldly and eventually she stopped texting me.

* So I'm with a girl I dont love and we're fighting for the stuppidest shit because she can't understand that she can be wrong and I eventually say ""okay okay you're right"" and then she's mad at me and I feel bad for it all. So I said okay give her a chance she'll fix and maybe this will grow into a healthy relationship, but no. 
Sex used to be a good thing in the beggining but even that went bad because all I think is how to get rid of her and I wouldn't go erect. The main reason I'm with her is because it's her last year in school and I dont want her to be depressed(yes that long because she's emotional as fuck) for her prom and to decide not to study or anything because of me. If that happens she and her parents will blame me.
Another thing is that she exaggerates about EVERYTHING so I know she will start telling all kinds of lies about me to everyone and I will deffinitely lose some friends because she's the girl, she's the weak one.. eventhough i'm the one without a voice and everytime I try to stand up for myself and tell her she's wrong she starts saying ""oh so I'm that bad oh im a stupid fucking idiot yea yea i know i'm shit so you're telling me i'ma liar"" and more more stupid stuff... I'm so tired of this that I've started to try avoiding her. Saying i'm sick and not going to school so I dont see her, going out with her rarely. I even just told her I'm going to be but I just want to write this in peace witout some one being mad at me if I dont respond to his/her text in less than 5 minutes.. I'm just unhappy and afraid to tell her just because she might go insane or something.

**TL;DR:** Soo I'm unhappy in my family, unhappy in trying to make my dreams come true, unhappy in my social communication (friends) because I'm unhappy in my relationship (conforming with pointless jealousy and stupidness).

**Sorry for long and unstructured post but I needed to get this off my chest.** 

If anyone is willing to chat with me somewhere PM me here.

I'll probably be adding more stuff if I remember something I've missed.

[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

One day when i was 16/17 i decided to check out this new forum/website that i had heard of since it seemed pretty popular. So i did i looked throughout  and on this day i came across a post which contained a bunch of images one of which image of a girl in a bikini which also had a shortened text link in the picture. So being the idiot i was i decided to check it out. When i got there it seemed to be a pretty similar website to the one i was on nothing special just a big forum dedicated to porn. but decided to check out some of the posts. And then thats when i found  out what exactly i had came up a website filled with nothing but CP just a bunch of picutes. Once i found out i panicked and left to never come back.

But around 1-3 months later i decided to go back(sadly i still remembered it).Why did i go back? If i had to say i was just horny and i made the worst mistake i could have and went back. After a while there i did my ""thing"" looking at the pics and left. I never went back. 

But ever since then i cannot go a day without thinking of what i did and its been years. When i think about it it goes on for hours upon hours. I lose sleep, i cant get myself to enjoy a single thing without it popping into my head of what i did those years ago and how much of a piece of shit i am. From grade 5-12 i was bullied and all that crap but i promised myself that i would always be a good person and never treat anyone or do anything like what they had done to me. Every time i think of that and how bad they were i immediately think of what i did and how much worse i am then them i did something i never believed i would do. Anything i do thats good wont mean shit, to me knowing what i have done.

And then i cant help but think of my future. What i find someone i love and they feel the same. How could i let them feel those feelings for me. How could i not tell them what i did. If they ever would know it would destroy absolutely everything with that person how could it not. why would they want to be with someone who did what i did. What if i got to the point where this person wanted to start a family. How could i have a child with this moment of what i did ingrained in my memory i wouldnt be able to stop thinking about what i did for a second. these just being a few things. If this memory had been haunting me for these years. it most definitely will continue for many more to come.

I broke my morals in the worst way i could ever have done. My morals are the one thing that has meant the most to me in my life. And it has been eating and eating away at me. If i wasnt such a bitch and scared. I would have done something to hurt myself or killed myself by now. But im sure give it another couple years ill have built up the guts to just end it all.

-Im sorry this is all a mess. Its just everything that has been going through my head since this event till now.

Tl;DR im a piece of shit for what i have done(as i know may other think the same). Everything i do has been effected is someway by this.

Everything in my life was good. Until living with my boyfriend turned out to be more like babysitting and always being disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love him, but not living with him. It also doesn't help that personally I'm in a great place, and he is not (Shit job, keeps getting turned down for good opportunities, friends all moved away, debt)... Our relationship is in a downward spiral. 

The part that turns this into a confession and keeps this from being a typical advice column letter is this: my new job.

I love it. And the kid who trained me. We have amazing chemistry. We are an unstoppable team when it comes to work. We listen to the same music, share stories, have our own jokes, send eachother things like memes or articles and we spend 40+ hrs a week together... He's not drop dead gorgeous (my boyfriend is much more attractive) but we have a weird connection for only having known eachother for a few months. I know what he's thinking all the time. And I have been wondering if he's had the same crush/romantic feelings toward me or if I'm a 'buddy'...the problem is- He got married to his college sweetheart 6 months ago. That's just about 3 months before I got this job. So I push the ideas away, and tell myself we're buddies. 

Except at the Christmas party...where we were all drinking...and stayed after...and he got so drunk and started saying things about how I looked good tonight and he can always count on me, and we should go out after work some time for beers. I got so uncomfortable because people were starting to notice how we were acting. I had to leave because I knew only bad things could come of me staying.
 
It's gotten to the point at work where we even kind of have signals to ""professionalize"" our demeanor toward each other because we forget we aren't alone all the time. 

Essentially I'm confessing to carrying on a secret, unspoken, undefined relationship, with a married coworker that I know has disastrous potential. And I feel terrible for his wife and my boyfriend, but I'm happiest when I'm at work.

Last night I finally got the proof that you have been lying to me. A feeling I've had for a long time but I guess I dismissed it because I so desperately wanted to believe you. I would question something and you would either answer with a laugh of disbelief or a sigh of frustration. I know now the laugh was because you couldn't believe how easily you were getting away with this and the sigh was a pause to recall which lie you had told.

 For months you have denied me affection, attention or even the most basic comforts of a married couple; living and sleeping in the same home. Your ""excuses"" and I call them excuses because ""reasons"" have logic, made no sense; here's a few of my favorite: ""I'm staying away because we need to really think about what we want"", ""I'm giving you some space so you can spend time with your kids"", ""I'm super busy at the store and this way I can work late without disturbing you"", ""Someone is coming in early to the store so I'm just going to stay there to get up early"". There were so many bullshit lines you told me and like a fool I believed them. I can't totally blame you; I wanted it to be true. I wanted to believe you were thinking only of our marriage, your love for me and becoming best friends again. It is true we see what we want to see and despite the flashing red lights in my face; I saw only you. I loved you that much.

Learning this only last night, you can imagine the state I'm in today. I finally fell asleep last night at 2 am. That was only because my body, physically, just couldn't take anymore crying. The images running rampant in my head, the lies that suddenly became very clear, the nights we would talk on the phone and I would pour my heart out to you only to find it all meant nothing. It was simply you pacifying me until you could find a way to make me mad so I would end it. A true coward you are. I woke up this morning at 5:30 am. As you know, I'm usually pretty positive in the morning; not today. I opened my eyes and then remembered what happened. As I struggled to pull myself out of my bed to wake my daughter for school, the tears started to flow again. Almost as if my heart has a direct line to my tears. After I got my daughter off to school, I went into my closet to try and find something to wear to work. What would seem like the simplest of tasks turned into a fight with my brain... Why can't I pick out clothes? At that moment, my heart went into overload and I dropped to the closet floor, sobbing uncontrollably. I can't even begin to describe the sheer anguish that flowed thru me. A pain so piercing, for a split second I wished death would end the suffering. It felt as though my heart was going to come right out of my throat in a million pieces. I yelled at myself to get up! ""Pick yourself up and get in the shower! You cannot let him destroy you! You have to go to work and you have to continue living!"" 
I got up and into the shower but these thoughts consume me. They eat at my very core. Holding my brain hostage and forcing me into auto pilot. I don't remember washing my hair, drying it, getting dressed... anything. I don't remember driving to work or clocking in. I feel nothing but this pain and confusion. It's almost as if I'm in a vacuum. It's hard to breathe, hard to function. 

I get encouragement from co-workers and friends. They can see the pain in my eyes and try their best to comfort me. Still, I'm numb. Seeing me go from this vibrant, ever sarcastic, smiling woman to this robotic lifeless corpse has got to be somewhat confusing for everyone.

I'm sure you're quite proud of yourself. You were able to break down this strong, independent, always positive woman. Quite a feat indeed.

I could go on to telling you how I knew you were lying but we both already know you were lying so why beat the dead horse? I will tell you this much; being with you for 6 years, hundreds of photos were taken by you of me. I know that photo... I was the subject of it many times. It was not off the internet. Who would save a picture of a bad tattoo and saggy boobs to their phone? It was a photo of a woman you were with. Please don't insult my intelligence. 

I hope she was worth everything you have lost. You are a selfish man. I really thought I was different. Everyone warned me, your friends included, that if you cheated with me you would eventually cheat on me. I defended you fiercely. I told everyone they didn't know you like I did. Love is truly blind...and deaf...and dumb. You succeeded in fooling me and you may relish in that fact but know this... You did so because I trusted you 100%. I loved you with every ounce of my being. Every bit of my heart was yours. Logic was thrown out the window with you. You fooled me because I let you have full reign of my heart. So this amazing feat that you accomplished was done so because another human being let you in 100%. A normal person would feel remorse for causing that kind of pain... but not you, no, you feel entitled to do as you please. 

Again, I hope she was worth the heart you destroyed. The trust that will never be in my heart again. Knowing that I will never let someone that close again. And on top of all that you had the audacity to scream you hate me. I catch you lying and you tell me you hate me? 
You were never worthy of me or my love and I think deep down you knew that. That was part of our conflict. All the things you said were wrong with me... were the things you hated about yourself. Take a long hard look at yourself. You lied, cheated, had another life online, didn't pay your bills on time, used people, put on that fake smile... 

Have a nice life.

Me

P.S. Your name will never cross my lips again. Your name is not worth mentioning.

There's this co-worker of who I thought was always very pretty (let's call her M). At the first sight of M I used to think ""wow! she is a very pretty girl"". I think I've had a period where I felt something for her, and even a few coworkers said that she'll fit with me. I loved to hear that; it made me feel pretty cool, haha.

However, M got a bit chubby and fat over the past few months. A few coworkers and I are good friends, and we always joke about everything and all. One co-worker went up to her and asked if she was pregnant because she got a bit chubby (or fat). She laughed, but I could see she couldn't really appreciate it. When that specific co-worker and M worked together again he once more proceeded to ask her if she was pregnant, to which she replied "" YOU SHOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW! I'M NOT PREGNANT!"". He told me over skype. I didn't want to be a dealbreaker but I think that went a bit far, and I actually thought it was sad for M. When we were on skype with another co-worker, he shared his screen with us. Do you know what he did? 

He went on facebook, went to M's profile and asked if she was still mad. ""Mad for what?"" she asked. ""PREGNANT"" he said. She replied ""I really don't care, I know better myself."" I pretended I thought it was funny, but I actually thought this went too far, and I said so to him that he's possibly hurting her feelings. What he did then was beyond me; he said to her, in the facebook chat ""Nvisser96 told me to do this"". After that he said ""No I'm kidding, Nvisser didn't told me to do this. I just wanted to do this"". That's right, he put the blame on ME. I've done nothing wrong and I actually felt a bit sick. I would never tell her something mean like this 3 times!

She didn't reply anymore, and I feel like I'm going to get screwed on work now when I work with her the next time. I don't  think she's going to believe that it wasn't my idea, though. I've never been mean to her, and I never would. I don't know M very well, but I'm kind of attracted to her, I think. She's pretty much in my head for the whole day, and this has been going on for a while. The crazy thing is, is that I don't feel love. What is going on?

First of all I want to say that I love my husband. He's a good man and treats me and our children well.
But my needs aren't being met. Hubby is gone most of the time for work and I'm very lonely so when this friend started texting me i jumped at the chance for human interaction.
It was completely innocent the first time i invited him (friend) over. I had no intention of being disloyal, but by the end of the night the conversation had turned not-so-innocent. The next time i invited him over it was for sex and it was the best sex i've ever had. It was just completely satisfying (he's so much bigger than my husband) he was just rough enough (hubby can't handle being rough at all) and there was so much energy. We had both had crushes for quite some time so there was a lot of pent up passion being released. I want it again. I want sex to be like that every time and hubby just can't deliver. I don't know if i will do it again. 
It's the first time I've lied to hubby and i hate doing it. It would absolutely destroy him if he found out.

**She is a aunt in-law. Does not make it less weird I guess.**


At first, it was just a fantasy. I thought it was teenage hormones raging, and although It was a family member, I thought it was a bit normal to be attracted to family but keep it under wraps.

I'm now 21 years old and it's safe to say that I've realized it's not just teenage hormones..it's real.

Let me start off by saying I'm not proud of what I'm about to say but rather embarrassed. At around 16 we were seeing my aunt rather frequently because family was close and we saw her every single weekend. 

First whenever I was alone with her I would take pictures of her discretely when she couldn't see me. Her husband and my dad out at a bar or something and me and her were alone most of the time. I would go home and masturbate to these pictures. I found a [playboy](http://imgur.com/bjWI60j) that looked pretty similar to her. I loved it.

I started wanting more and more to see her naked. I started thinking of ways to achieve this without getting caught or arousing suspicion. I figured out that if I was quiet, I could quietly open her door and watch her undress before she showers every time. One time I kept the door cracked and watched her shower. I kept several pictures and videos of this, and even masturbated watching a few times. 

After this point, I reached what I believed to my peak when I stole her panties to keep. She would get undressed in her bedroom, grab a towel from her dresser and head to the bathroom. One day I grabbed her panties and threw the rest of her clothes in her dirty clothes bin. I ran back to the couch with her panties in my pocket, and played my IOS game. 

She never accused me or even asked about it. I'm pretty sure just like we all do sometimes, question something and think ""I must have put the clothes in there already"" and shook it off.

I've had dreams of having sex with her and her masturbating. I look at her and lately have been thinking of how to have sex with her. The best route I've seen is drinking with her. She always had been really flirty when drunk and I figured I would take advantage of it. 

I would never force her to do anything, but I'm going to make a move when we are both drunk and if she does not have a good reaction I would damage control by apologizing and blaming it on the alcohol. I figure I will just slowly flirt with her and see how far it goes.

I feel guilty and regretful that it has reached this point but I'm honestly seriously attracted to her and I just really want to just go for it. A week from now is our pre Christmas party and that's when I'm going to make my move.

He was a year ahead of me at a different school but much older than me, having gone back as a mature student. He since graduated and got a great job but in a very small city (really just a big town) about 2 hours from our hometown and 2 hours from where I'm at college. I'm graduating this coming year and I'm supposed to figure out what to do with me life...but the truth is I just want to go and move in with him. I love the city he lives in, he's an amazing guy, he has a fantastic job. I don't have any passion for my degree and I don't really know what else I want to do. I've always liked writing, and for a while wanted to go into publishing or something. 

Everyone always expected me to be the career woman. throughout high school I always got what I wanted, I was top of the class, I was the best at anything I set my mind to and a lot of people looked up to me (I was pretty mellow about it, I'm only arrogant now that I'm average :P). 

But the truth is, if my parents weren't going to be deathly disappointed, I'd honestly give up my career for a smaller job or life, but one I can spend with him. He's not just some chump, I swear. He really is great. 

At least for a few years, before I figure my life out. 

But my Dad's been talking to people in the industry to set up internships and stuff. I wish I could break it to him.

We sleep in different bedrooms and we have not had sex since our honeymoon (I stopped trying once it became clear how uninterested he was).  To top it off, as I have realized how much I want children, he has concluded that he does not.  

I beat back resentment as much as possible because I know that if I let it overwhelm me then there is no chance of saving things.  But honestly, its just a matter of time before its done.  I feel like a failure and I am still so attached to him and to the life we have together.  He is a good man, we are just not meant to be together.  I don't know why I didn't realize this before the wedding, but I think I thought that if we had been together for three years and loved each other, it would just magically work out.

I am devastated and can't think of how I could possibly talk to him about this.  The subject has come up a few times when we have talked about the sex issue and the children issue, so I know he wouldn't be shocked.  But I do know he will be heartbroken and it utterly breaks my heart to think about that and to consider the future.
